# Leaders #
POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "그 어떤 포니들이 감히 예상하는 것보다 나이가 많은 알리콘인 셀레스티아 공주는 두 왕실 자매 중 언니이자 이퀘스트리아의 통치자입니다. 그녀는 안정된 밤과 낮 주기를 보장하기 위해 그의 여동생 루나와 함께 해를 올리고 내리는 역할을 맡고 있습니다. 그녀는 아마도 평화, 친절, 협력을 확고히 지지하는, 세계에서 가장 사랑받는 포니일 것입니다. 셀레스티아가 디스코드를 이기기 전의 과거에 대해선 거의 알려지지 않았으나, 그녀와 루나가 조화의 원소를 그때 발견했다고 알려져 있습니다. 이 원소, 그리고 각각의 원소에 맞는 포니들을 통해 셀레스티아 공주는 국가에 긴 평화를 가져왔습니다."
POLITICS_CELESTIA_LUNA_DESC:0 "이퀘스트리아의 공주 셀레스티아와 루나는 각각 태양과 달의 힘을 가지고 있습니다. 양두 정치 체제에도 불구하고 이퀘스트리아는 항상 셀레스티아가 통치해 왔으며 루나는 조연 역할만 맡아 왔습니다. 최근 이퀘스트리아로 네 번째 종족을 받아들이는 운동이 이를 바꾸었고, 루나 공주는 이제 자신의 언니와 함께 서로를 보완해 가며 그녀의 국민들의 꿈을 실현해주기 위해 노력하고 있습니다."
CHANCELLOR_NEIGHSAY_DESC:0 "Neighsay is strict and conservative, preferring to do things by the EEA guidelines. He is also very prejudiced against anyone who is not a pony, openly referring to non-ponies as "creatures" in a dismissive manner."
POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "데이브레이커는 셀레스티아의 오만한 대체 자아입니다. 데이브레이커는 상당히 오만하고, 권력에 굶주려 있으며, 분노로 가득 차 있습니다. 그녀는 루나나 다른 포니들이 필요하지 않다고 자랑하며, 루나를 달로 추방하는 대신 그녀를 파괴했어야 한다고 주장합니다. 데이브레이커는 그녀의 철발굽 아래 하나의 국가를 이룩하고 모든 것들을 지배하기 위해 균형과 조화를 무시합니다. 데이브레이커는 셀레스티아보다 더 많은 태양의 힘을 이용해서 그녀가 불을 뿜거나 강렬하고 불타는 빛을 발생시키게 해 줍니다."
POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "A well educated and accomplished general from the Equestrian military, Prince Blueblood rode his popularity as a hero of Equestria and his traditionally inherited power as a prince through the elections and into his new role as the executive of the nation. His tactics as a general were strict, disciplined, and conservative, not to mention highly effective, and he carries those methodologies into his administration. Though not necessarily the most humble politician, Blueblood knows how, when, and what to say what the public wants to hear, knows what the public wants, and has the intellect to carry out their will efficiently. Finally, his knowledge as a general gives his pragmatic administration great insight into the military and the defensive needs of the nation, essential in the torn and chaotic modern world."
POLITICS_RICH_DESC:0 "A member of Equestria’s nouveau riche at least by Canterloninan standards, Filthy Rich is a pioneering capitalist and industrialist. Ruthless in his business tactics though perhaps not the sharpest at governmental administration as demonstrated by his first and only term as Mayor of Ponyville, his skills at the trade floor translate well to the negotiations table in economic matters. He entered the new democratic political scene through his financial influence and power, under the simple but to some, sort of unsettling catchphrase "Make Equestria Great Again", though not exactly specifying how in the face of opponents with more clear motives, goals, and methods."
POLITICS_PANTS_DESC:0 "Fancy Pants is a renowned member of the old Canterlot elite aristocracy, a shrewd businesspony and a clever diplomat. Though uptight as many Canterlotians are, he has occasionally shown a softer side such as his favorable business dealings with Rarity and forgiveness to the aid of Princess Twilight Sparkle after a notable debacle while she was attending other business. With these qualities, he is a natural choice for a leader that the traditional elite are content with, though some ponies may not agree with his strongly orthodox methods and policy."
POLITICS_MARE_DESC:0 "Considered a pioneer in many respects, Mayor Mare, otherwise known as Flitter Flutter, trailblazed many aspects of democratic campaigning at the local level. Despite a few rough patches in her long administration as the Mayor of Ponyville, losing once to Filthy Rich, she has proven to be both a well meaning and effective leader and diplomat, again at the local level. It remains to be seen if she can effectively run a whole nation as well as she can run a city."
POLITICS_GEARHEART_DESC:0 "A selfmade mare, Copper Gearheart came from humble beginnings as a failed magic student and an eccentric engineer/inventor. After her failure in university in Canterlot, she returned to her home city of Manehattan with at least one magical talent, hyperprecise telekinesis that augmented her innovative mind as she joined the rapidly growing industrial revolution, and by 1007, she was the head of a rapidly growing industrial company with technological research at its heart. During the Lunar Civil War, she entered the political scene with a staunch progressive platform focused on scientific progress, redefining the government by democratic principles, and advocated for the disempowerment of the old hereditary elite."
POLITICS_ETERNAL_DESC:0 "Hailing from the wide, warm open plains of southwest Equestria, Maxos Eternal was part of the last generations of rural frontierspony and later a successful landowning rancher. He was a stallion who cared very much about his fellow equine and looked to make his mark helping others, becoming a key figure in maintaining the Equestrian food supply and overall rationing system when the Lunar Civil War broke out. He naturally became part of the political scene in the wake of the democratic movement after the civil war due to his popularity and reputation for fairness, joining the movement on a platform of simply hearing out his fellow ponies and acting on their wishes."
POLITICS_LEAD_DESC:0 "Ledd Metal was an established blacksmith within the traditional medieval guild system of Equestria when the Equestrian Industrial Revolution came full swing in the 980s, he became caught up in the winds of change as many guilds and craftsponies gave way to unskilled labor and unions. Disgruntled by the waves of change, avoiding the draft during the Lunar Civil War as a skilled metalworker, and seeing his fellow ponies striving to determine their own fates, he pulled together the support of the remaining old guilds, he joined the political scene on the platform to preserve the old harmonic order with the new methods of democracy."
POLITICS_SPARK_DESC:0 "Ember Spark was a veteran Pegasus trooper and one of the most decorated enlisted soldiers in the Equestrian Army, having joined as soon as he was eligible in 997. He proved to be a capable and fair leader who turned down promotions to an officer several times. At the behest of many of his fellows in the army, he reluctantly joined the rising democratic movement during an R&R period during the Lunar Civil War. Once it had ended, with the support of his many brothers and sisters in arms, he took up a platform focused on the defense of future peace and harmony in this new, changed Equestria."

POLITICS_NIGHTMAREMOON_DESC:0 "나이트메어 문은 셀레스티아 공주의 여동생인 루나 공주가 타락한 존재입니다. 나이트메어 문은 그녀가 달로 추방되었을 때 만들어진 것으로, 그녀의 통치 하에서는 밤이 모두를 다스리고 조화의 이상은 산산조각이 납니다. 루나 여제는 법, 질서, 그리고 영원한 밤의 세계를 세우기를 바라며 그녀의 모든 영토에 군림합니다."

## Olenia ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_KINGJOHAN_DESC:0 "King Johan, the illegitimate son of the King Aldar II seized power after his father's sudden death."
POLITICS_VELVET_DESC:0 "Queen Velvet, the only child of King Aldar II, is respected and beloved by the deer of Olenia."
POLITICS_JURVA_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_KULLERVO_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_MANNTLERHIM_DESC:0 "Carl Gustaf Manntlerhim is an aging and respected soldier. His position as Commandant of Olenia puts him second only to the King in terms of power. But who’s side will he remain loyal to?"
POLITICS_HAAKON_DESC:0 "Haakon Lurswig, the nephew of Korvensuu founder Carl Lurswig, is a pioneer of mechanized combat. His experiments into tank designs and their usage in combat is revolutionary. But will he have a chance to see them come to fruition?"

## Changeling ##
# Leaders #

POLITICS_CHRYSALIS_DESC:0  "Ruler and despot of the Changeling Hives, Queen Chrysalis was the first of her race to unite them under one banner. From her hatching in 930, she has proven to be an exceptional individual. Being the only child of the dead Queen of Vesalipolis, she was raised with extreme care and given best possible education, which made her spoiled and arrogant, but also intelligent, determined and firm. She was crowned in 945 and fended off an attack from Vraks with her army. Soon after, the Vesalipolis-Ditrysium axis was formed, and it would be the embryo for united Changeling Lands.\n\nUnder her leadership, other hive queens either joined her voluntarily or were forced into submission. She became the sole absolute ruler of her species in 988, but her ambitions only continued to grow. She plotted to coup and invade Equestria, and executed her plans in 1002. Chrysalis herself replaced Princess Cadence and had fooled nearly everyone, and had even bested Princess Celestia. It was by mere fluke that her victory was snatched away from her grasp and her people banished to the frozen North. Clearly infiltration alone is not enough to reclaim what is rightfully hers, and Chrysalis recognises the need of a powerful and modern military. Any opposition and protest to her despotic reign is swiftly crushed as she prepares to redeem her honour, or die trying."


## Dragon Tribe ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_CRIMSON_DESC:0 "On the mountain, Crimson "Ruby" Hayden has watched as Dragons fought over wealth, distrscted by materialism. From early fights and violence between her kind being observed by her, she began to grow a hatred to the Dynasty. After a visit to Stalliongrad, her thoughts began to radicalize, forming the DFCP in 1007 with nationalist, Communist principles. Haydenism is now a popular thought contrast to traditional dragon thought."

## Polar Bears ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PWELLINGTON_DESC:0 "Paw Wellington had emerged as the despot of the fractured polar communities in 1002. Under his reign, the polar bears have finally organized into a civil society. He is remarked as being firm but fair, willing to share the fish and having soft paws. Since his rise to power, the bears have seen rather decent success."

## Yakistan ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride."

## Jakistan ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PRINCEBRADFORD_DESC:0 "To the East of the internationally recognized country of Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford holds claim over a clan of Yaks whom call themselves the 'Jaki-Clan.' A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks - or Jaks, depending on who you ask - to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position."

## Crystal Empre ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_CADENZA_DESC:0 "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, better known as Cadance, is another Alicorn Princess, though she began life as a Pegasus. After overcoming a jealous sorceress by opening her heart to her, Cadence was elevated into Alicornhood and joined Luna and Celestia in the Equestrian Royal Family as the Princess of Love. There she fell in love with a young Shining Armour, and married him. Unfortunately, their wedding was used by the Changeling Queen, Chrysalis, to overthrow the Royal Family and take over Equestria. With the power of their love, Shining Armour and Cadence managed to thwart the invasion and repelled the Changeling forces out of the country. After some time, Cadence was installed as the leader of the Crystal Empire and has since safekept it along with her husband."
POLITICS_SOMBRA_DESC:0 "Sombra’s origins are as mysterious as the mere mention of his name is unsettling. Whatever memories of his past have long been forgotten, perhaps even by himself. What is known of him and his rule over the Crystal Empire paints a grim picture: as King, he enslaved and tortured his own subjects to further his powers. He was only stopped when he was banished by Princess Celestia and Luna over a thousand years ago, along with his empire. When he returned, Sombra had become an immaterial creature of shadow, and threatened to take over the Crystal Empire once more were it not for the combined efforts of Princess Cadence and the Bearers of the Elements of Harmony. His form might have been gone, but his essence remained. This pony might not be the Sombra of the past, but he is just as cruel and tyrannical as the tales describe. One thing is sure: the King is back."

## Strawberry ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_EAGLECLAW_DESC:0 "Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw of the Strawberry Duchy is the cousin of Grover V, the Griffonian Emperor and is a griffin who holds vast tracts of land and large amounts of wealth. Were Grover to pass away, she would be a prime candidate to become regent and certainly feels that she would be the only one suitable!\n\nShe is a staunch supporter of the nobility and she will try to uphold the balance between the nobles, religion and the people. She does truly care for her people though, and wants to see them prosper above all else; she even has plans for some minor reforms in the pipeline!\n\nWhile she is no stranger to the life as a noble, ruling her own Duchy would be nothing compared to ruling an entire empire and she might find herself part of a larger power-struggle, tearing the empire apart."
