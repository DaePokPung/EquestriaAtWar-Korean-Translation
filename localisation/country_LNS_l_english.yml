LNS_return_to_genesis:0 "다시 하나되다"
LNS_return_to_genesis_desc:0 "When Grover II marched east, crushing Duke Žemaitukas under his countless hordes, he pushed many a pony out of their homes with his campaigns of destruction. Even after he was defeated and his armies pushed back, the Vartai remained under griffon control which ensured a slow, yet steady stream of native ponies fleeing griffon domination and enforced Herzlander-Imperial culture. The rise of Black Cloaks only increased the fervour of this retreat as tens of thousands left for better lives in various states of Riverlands. Some of these outcasts or their descendants came back to assist during the civil war, forming several minor military units which by themselves didn’t contribute much to our forces.\n\nHowever something seems to have changed rather soon after Povner assumed control. Outcasts, exiles, refugees and their descendants started flooding back into Longsword, answering calls to return to their homeland seemingly en masse.\n\nWhile this rapid flood of, seeming, believers of Varėnė is allowing for a somewhat rapid increase of our military forces and settling previously devastated lands, many ponies that persisted within Longsword seem somewhat bitter that those who fled in fear or their descendants are being accepted back. While this doesn’t seem to by anything that would lead to substantial inner strife, the antagonism between both groups is noticeable."
LNS_griffon_converts:0 "The Reborn"
LNS_griffon_converts_desc:0 "While Abba Povner is usually a rather cold and lacking in charisma individual, there are a couple occasions where this changes, that being either when the "Soldier of the Gods" is writing or reciting his poetry which has captured and enveloped the minds of many, or when he speaks of the will of Varėnė and other gods and the native faith of Vartai. Perhaps it was through such means that Povner reached the minds and hearts of the countless knights that lost faith in the griffon creator gods and any sort of noble ideal that might have existed in their homelands.\n\nWhatever is the case, there are now entire legions of griffon knights that have removed any symbol of country or house ready to fight for Varėnė and her faithful and train any new armies of newly converted griffon believers."

LNS_resist_and_bite_desc:0 "암울한 현실을 마주해야 할 때입니다. 더스크탈론과 그의 개혁파 하수인들은 우리를 멸절시키기 위해 절대 멈추지 않을 것입니다. 그렇기에 우리는 싸워야 하고 싸울 겁니다! 우리는 숲에서, 거리에서, 그리고 평야에서 맞서 싸울 겁니다! 우리가 실패하고 모두 죽더라도 한 가지는 확실합니다. 우리는 저항하고 마지막까지 놈들을 물어뜯을 겁니다!"
LNS_our_friends_in_hellquill:0 "헬퀼로부터의 지원"
LNS_our_friends_in_hellquill_desc:0 "우리는 헬퀼의 동지들로부터 지원을 받을 준비가 되었습니다만, 우선 지원자들이 쿠피스키스 마을을 지나야 비크슈타트까지 도달할 수 있을 겁니다. 그곳은 개혁파의 영향력이 약하지만 우리가 마냥 위험으로부터 안전하다는 뜻은 아닙니다."
LNS_target_collaborators:0 "부역자들을 노려라"
LNS_target_collaborators_desc:0 "모두가 미친 백작의 절멸계획을 따르는 것은 아니지만 사람들은 적극적으로던 소극적으로던 그를 지원합니다. 살인마들에 부역하고 그냥 넘어갈 수 없다는 것을 그들에게 보여줘야 합니다."
LNS_spread_pamphlets:0 "모두에게 알려라"
LNS_spread_pamphlets_desc:0 "우리는 검은 망토들에 대항하는 우리들의 사상과 이유를 담은 팜플렛과 포스터를 인쇄해 밤중에 도시 전역에 배포할 겁니다."
LNS_steal_equipment:0 "총을 훔쳐내라"
LNS_steal_equipment_desc:0 "승리의 가능성을 만들기 위해 우리 병력들에게 제공할 화기를 충분히 확보해야 합니다. 무기를 장악할 만한 장소 두 군데를 찾아 두었습니다."
LNS_organize_cells:0 "불가항력에 대비하라"
LNS_organize_cells_desc:0 "곧 우리는 개혁파와 전면전을 치르게 될겁니다. 우리는 게릴라전에 강하지만 대의를 위해 추가적인 포니들을 모집하고 진짜 전투에 대비한 훈련 요법을 늘려야 합니다."
LNS_the_secret_government:0 "비밀 정부"
LNS_the_secret_government_desc:0 "개혁파 놈들을 쓸어버린 후의 원할한 정부 전환을 위해 스타리 나이트는 예비 정부를 구성하기로 결정했습니다. 이들은 각자 주요 직책을 맡아 정상상태로의 빠른 전환을 보장할 겁니다."
LNS_sabotage_them:0 "사보타주!"
LNS_sabotage_them_desc:0 "우리는 개혁파에 대한 교란을 강화해야 합니다. 파르티잔 조직원들을 보내 그들의 장교진을 암살하고 공장을 불태울 겁니다."
LNS_an_example:0 "무력시위"
LNS_an_example_desc:0 "격분스러운 일입니다! 검은 망토 놈들이 무고한 포니들을 바레나의 노동 수용소에 밀어 넣고 있습니다. 포니들이 학살당하거나 어쩌면 더 심한 일을 당하기 전에 당장 이에 대응해야 합니다."
LNS_the_uprising_desc:0 "포니들이여 무장하라! 더스크달론과 그 일당들은 범죄에 대한 댓가를 치를 것이다! 롱소드는 놈들의 폭정에서 벗어나리라!"

LNS_the_military_resists:0 "Oppose the Count"
LNS_the_military_resists_desc:0 "We've had enough of the Count's madness. Slaughter of innocent ponies isn't what Longsword stands for! Conrad Silvertalon, our highest decorated general, will approach Dusktalon and attempt to convince him to end this butchery."
LNS_reassign_units:0 "Misplaced Orders"
LNS_reassign_units_desc:0 "Silvertalon has intercepted orders for the military from the Count and has "accidently" lost them. They will be replaced with ones more suitable to our growing resistance and more resistant to attempts to win them over from the Reformisten."
LNS_our_duty:0 "Prepare for the Fight Ahead"
LNS_our_duty_desc:0 "Every one of us is committed to liberating Longsword from the Reformisten menace, but first we must adequately prepare, if we are to openly oppose them. The streets of Zeltstadt and other towns in the area have labyrinthine streets and nooks that can be exploited, should they come to visit."
LNS_ensure_loyalty:0 "Cull Reformisten in the Army"
LNS_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "The extremist elements in the army need to be removed, otherwise they'll endanger our plans to bring back peace to Longsword. If a few key officers could just be removed by various means, once the fight comes, their lack of presence would be a certain loss for the Count."
LNS_black_market_contacts:0 "Arms Shipment Diversion"
LNS_black_market_contacts_desc:0 "We've convinced sympathetic griffons from the Heartlands to deliver the next weapon transport to Zeltstadt. Containing many of the newest weapons, it will be a boon to us, what we can take at least."
LNS_requisition_weapons:0 "Weapons for the Cause"
LNS_requisition_weapons_desc:0 "With the Reformisten tightly controlling most of the firearm production, we're forced to seek more clandestine methods of equipping our troops. Perhaps, maybe, we can persuade some weaker links in the chain to break."
LNS_refuse_orders:0 "Open Resistance"
LNS_refuse_orders_desc:0 "We've built up our strength to a sufficient amount to openly defy the Reformisten. All those loyal to our cause will be instructed to gather at Zeltstadt with what weapons they can find. We will gather out forces and prepare for the storm ahead."
LNS_target_reformisten:0 "Target Black Cloaks"
LNS_target_reformisten_desc:0 "The Reformisten are a blight on our country's good name. We shall murder their supporters wherever we find them, and make others think twice before joining them. Perhaps a little off-the-book justice meted out in the night will work..."
LNS_target_partisans:0 "The Partisan Issue"
LNS_target_partisans_desc:0 "While the Reformisten are our main enemy, the Partisans have been gearing up for open conflict, as well. We sympathise with the ponies, but their radical members will undoubtedly instruct them to attack us. Some effort will be divested towards weakening them."
LNS_the_madgriffon_of_longsword:0 "March Upon Swordsson"
LNS_the_madgriffon_of_longsword_desc:0 "Let the Earth tremble as the righteous forces of Longsword marches on Swordsson. We shall desail the Reformisten bastion, and burn it to the ground. Let those that commit the crimes against all be met with the sword."

LNS_the_plan_continues:0 "계획을 계속하다"
LNS_the_plan_continues_desc:0 "한심한 포니들이 살아있는 것도 이제 마지막이다. 우리는 포니들을 전부 죽여 묻어버리기 전까지 멈추지 않을 것이다! 우리의 구세주인 개혁파에 영광을!"
LNS_investigate_the_military:0 "지휘관들을 조사하다"
LNS_investigate_the_military_desc:0 "우리 장군 중 일부는 우리 대의에 충실하지 못하다. 그들은 불만없이 업무를 수행 할 더 적합한 그리폰들로 대체될 것이다."
LNS_root_out_traitors:0 "민간 행정 재구정"
LNS_root_out_traitors_desc:0 "방해꾼 관료들은 처음부터 골칫거리였지. 그들은 우리의 그리폰들로 신속히 대체될것이다."
LNS_public_executions:0 "공개 처형"
LNS_public_executions_desc:0 "확실히 반역자들에겐 아직 교훈이 부족한 것 같군. 우리를 거역하면 어찌 되는지 공개적으로 보여주면 충분한 위협이 되겠지."
LNS_work_them_to_the_bone:0 "노동 수용소"
LNS_work_them_to_the_bone_desc:0 "포니들은 전부 죽여버리는게 맞지만 그 전에 우리를 위해 강제 노동을 시킨다면 더욱 도움이 되겠지. 바레나에 수용소를 세우도록 하자."
LNS_steal_their_property:0 "재산 압류"
LNS_steal_their_property_desc:0 "살았건 죽었건 포니들은 동전 한 닢, 땅 한 뼘 조차 가질 자격이 없다. 롱소드를 위해 우리의 목표를 이루는 데 도움이 되는게 있다면 전부 압수하라."
LNS_plans_backfire:0 "계획이 역효과를 내다"
LNS_plans_backfire_desc:0 "우리의 노력에도 불구하고 계속되는 좌절뿐이다. 헬퀼의 동맹들은 현 상황에 만족스럽지 못하나 백작께서 우리 문제의 해결책을 제시하실 것이다."
LNS_panic_in_the_countryside:0 "파르티잔 봉기"
LNS_panic_in_the_countryside_desc:0 "빌어먹을! 우리의 광범위한 억압 정책에도 포니 쓰레기들이 지방에서 대규모 봉기를 일으켜 지역을 장악했다! 놈들을 가혹하게 처단해야만 한다."
LNS_mass_mutinies:0 "군대 반란"
LNS_mass_mutinies_desc:0 "우리 군대가 반란을 일으켰다! 그들은 물러 터져서 이른바 "학살"에 참여하지 못하겠다는군. 우리는 롱소드를 구하려는 것인데 왜 이해를 못하는 거지?"
LNS_mass_uprising:0 "불길이 솟구친다"
LNS_mass_uprising_desc:0 "우리는 반역자와 반란군에 둘러쌓였다! 얼마나 우리에 반대하던 상관 없어. 죽더라도 우리는 롱소드를 정화할 것이다!"

LNS_fascist_civil_war:0 "더러운 자들을 제거하라"
LNS_fascist_civil_war_desc:0 "그래, 반역자들이 결국 공개적을 자신들을 드러냈다 이거지? 더욱 좋군! 이제 놈들을 손쉽게 학살할 수 있겠어, 결정적인 단 한번의 공세로 말이지. 전진(Vorwärts)!"
LNS_emergency_conscription:0 "징집령"
LNS_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "필수적이지 않은 직종에서 근무하는 모든 그리폰은 우리 군으로 징집될 것이다. 개혁파는 승리하리라!"
LNS_hasty_militias:0 "개혁파 광신자"
LNS_hasty_militias_desc:0 "살인자나 깡패, 광신자들을 보통 정규군으로 모집하지는 않습니다만 지금은 어려운 시기이고 포니들을 물리치기 위해 모든 그리폰의 도움이 필요합니다. 헬퀼에서 우리를 돕기 위해 자원병이 추가적으로 도착하였습니다."
LNS_child_soldiers:0 "모든 그리폰 징집"
LNS_child_soldiers_desc:0 "경제를 이렇게 희생시키는 것은 참 안타까운 일이지만, 우리의 존망이 걸린 상황에서 군인과 민간인의 구분은 필요없습니다. 모두를 위한 총을! 어쩌면 적들은 "민간인"을 쏘는걸 주저할지도 모르죠."
LNS_grab_the_pistols:0 "헬퀴에서 온 보급품"
LNS_grab_the_pistols_desc:0 "We shall call upon our allies from Hellquill to provide us with the much needed weaponry for our soldiers. Hopefully, they'll loan us a plenty."
LNS_grab_the_muskets:0 "더 애원하기"
LNS_grab_the_muskets_desc:0 "이거로는 부족해! 전쟁의 잔혹한 현실은 총기를 끝없이 요구한다. 헬퀼로 사절을 다시 보내 우리의 절박함을 알리란 말이다!"
LNS_sharpen_spears:0 "Weapons of the Heroic Age"
LNS_sharpen_spears_desc:0 "Despite our best attempts to increase production and procure supplies from Hellquill, we still lack weapons for our troops. We have no other option but to use swords and spears used by our heroic ancestors in defence of Longsword. The troops better show a little respect for the relics."
LNS_houses_to_factories:0 "Houses to Factories"
LNS_houses_to_factories_desc:0 "Private property will be seized in order to convert them to impromptu factories, so we can produce necessary goods for our war effort."
LNS_we_need_more:0 "Seize Private Workshops"
LNS_we_need_more_desc:0 "Despite our efforts in maximising our production through longer work shifts and more workers, we still can't produce enough firearms for the troops. The solution lies in demanding production for the state from private manufactories, gunsmiths and workshops."
LNS_final_push:0 "영광을 위해!"
LNS_final_push_desc:0 "See how our enemy flees before us! Each Reformisten is worth at least three traitors! Victory lies just beyond our reach!"

LNS_commie_civil_war:0 "혁명!"
LNS_commie_civil_war_desc:0 "나를 따르라 동지들이여! 증오받는 폭군을 이 땅에서 쫒아내고 사회주의 유토피아를 건설하자!"
LNS_the_faith_of_the_people:0 "민중의 믿음"
LNS_the_faith_of_the_people_desc:0 "어려운 시기이지만 우리는 이 나라를 살인자와 깡패들로부터 해방하는 중이고 민중은 이러한 우리의 편입니다. 그들의 지원은 큰 도움이 될 겁니다."
LNS_peoples_militias:0 "민병대를 소집하라!"
LNS_peoples_militias_desc:0 "포니들과 포니에 동정적인 그리폰들이 우리에게 모여들고 있습니다. 그들을 무장시켜 전선으로 보냅시다!"
LNS_foreign_volunteers:0 "외국의 지원"
LNS_foreign_volunteers_desc:0 "주변 국가들에서 우리와 한뜻인 동지들이 무기와 병력을 보내왔습니다. 우린 이 도움에 진심으로 감사를 표합니다."
LNS_cottage_industry:0 "뒷마당 제련소"
LNS_cottage_industry_desc:0 "인민은 자신의 능력을 과소평가하지 말아야 합니다. 인민의 산업적 역량 또한 마찬가지입니다! 우리에겐 그리폰의 공장들이 필요하지 않습니다. 주워온 재료들과 즉석 장비들을 이용해서도 집과 농장에서 필요한 물품들을 생산 할 수 있습니다."
LNS_underground_arms_factories:0 "소총 제조사"
LNS_underground_arms_factories_desc:0 "기존 무기들을 구해다 쓰는 것으로는 부족하며, 이제 직접 새 무기를 생산해야 합니다. 대장장이, 금속세공사, 목수들을 모두 총기제작에 투입할 겁니다! 품질이 좋다고는 할 수는 없겠지만 충분할 정도는 될 겁니다."
LNS_wartime_propaganda:0 "적을 알라"
LNS_wartime_propaganda_desc:0 "우리의 대의를 위해 싸우는 모두는 개혁파의 끔찍한 범죄행위를 분명하게 알아야 합니다. 인민들에게 또한 이를 가르쳐 그들에 적에게 부역하는 것을 방지해야 합니다!"
LNS_smuggle_guns:0 "총기 "수입""
LNS_smuggle_guns_desc:0 "레이크 시티의 동료 포니들이 최신 화기들이 보관된 무기 보관함을 확보해 주었습니다. 우리에게 큰 도움이 되겠죠."
LNS_breakout_musuem_pieces:0 "옛 총기 재활용"
LNS_breakout_musuem_pieces_desc:0 "썩 유쾌하지는 않지만 박물관의 화승총이나 개인 수집용품 역시 압류해 사용할 수밖에 없습니다. 어찌됬건 총알만 나가면 죽이는 데는 문제 없으니까요."
LNS_to_victory:0 "자유를 위해!"
LNS_to_victory_desc:0 "우리의 승리는 확정적입니다! 파시스트 깡패들에게는 최후의 보루만이 남아 있고, 그들이 무너진 지금 공격하면 됩니다!"

LNS_neutral_civil_war:0 "Our Duty"
LNS_neutral_civil_war_desc:0 "Since ages past, our duty was to protect the griffon way of life from pony incursions. We were merely defending ourselves, but Dusktalon's horrifying plan will undoubtedly cause the entire River Coalition to attack us! He must be stopped!"
LNS_keep_calm:0 "Remain Steady"
LNS_keep_calm_desc:0 "Maintain your discipline, soldiers! Our cause is just and there is no need to panic. Remind the populace what we fight for."
LNS_keep_it_professional:0 "Conscript the Reservists"
LNS_keep_it_professional_desc:0 "It has come to this sooner than expected, but we're forced to send our reserve forces to the frontline in order to have a chance of victory."
LNS_and_man_the_cannons:0 "Artillery for the Cause"
LNS_and_man_the_cannons_desc:0 "We have seized a shipment of artillery headed for Swordsson! Quickly, give the troops rudimentary training and include them in our divisions!"
LNS_smalltime_industry:0 "Smalltime Industry"
LNS_smalltime_industry_desc:0 "We shall send a notice to the general population - every griffon or pony who is capable of producing any materiel for the war effort should volunteer to assist us. They'll be adequately compensated."
LNS_military_industry:0 "Economic Calibration"
LNS_military_industry_desc:0 "In times of war, some amenities have to be forfeited, and so we shall switch the production lines to make firearms for our soldiers."
LNS_old_rifles:0 "Old Guns"
LNS_old_rifles_desc:0 "Our friends from the Imperial Heartlands have chipped in with a much welcome supply of weaponry. They might be slightly outdated, but they're much better than what most soldiers are wielding."
LNS_service_gurantees_citizenship:0 "Ponies in the Army"
LNS_service_gurantees_citizenship_desc:0 "The ponies have no love for the Reformisten, and we shall capitalise on this. Each pony who joins our forces will receive citizenship after the war is over, with all the benefits it entails."
LNS_desperate_measures:0 "Desperate Measures"
LNS_desperate_measures_desc:0 "Unfortunately, due to the chronic lack of strategic resources, we are unable to maintain a large production of latest firearms. We're forced to switch to older, but cheaper models."
LNS_semper_fi:0 "영광을 위해!"
LNS_semper_fi_desc:0 "잔인한 폭군을 이 땅에서 쫒아내라! 롱소드는 해방될 것이고 우리의 명예와 전통 역시 회복될 것이다!"

LNS_bandit_victory:0 "Heidenreich's Takeover"
LNS_bandit_victory_desc:0 ""Throw Dusktalon's body in the river, shoot anyone who objects, we're running this country my way now, and I've got some much better ideas than petty murdering...""
LNS_consolidate_power:0 "Consolidate Our Power"
LNS_consolidate_power_desc:0 "Even now, we've still got remnants from the civil war opposing us - Partisans, Reformisten, loyalist soldiers and more. Can't they see we've clearly won? We must teach the remainder a harsh lesson for opposing Rosa Heidenreich."
LNS_a_chance_meeting:0 "A Chance Meeting"
LNS_a_chance_meeting_desc:0 "Heidenreich is feeling rather discontent with life lately. Perhaps a good raid will drag her out of her misery."
LNS_a_lovely_gift:0 "A Lovely Gift"
LNS_a_lovely_gift_desc:0 "Heidenreich was so charmed by Eriviar's gift! She has requested that we send a gift in return, just as splendid! We might not have much, but surely there's benefits in having close relations with a foreign power."
LNS_some_wonderful_protection:0 "Some Wonderful Protection"
LNS_some_wonderful_protection_desc:0 "As a show of affection towards his beloved Rosa, Eriviar has sent some of his best bodyguards to our lands. Isn't he wonderful?"
LNS_a_return_gift:0 "A Token of Love"
LNS_a_return_gift_desc:0 "The budding relationship between Heidenreich and Eriviar has resulted in some benefits for us all, as the Sunstriker leader has sent us a caravan full of stolen goods, with slaves too!"
LNS_a_pleasant_evening:0 "A Pleasant Evening"
LNS_a_pleasant_evening_desc:0 "Heidenreich has been planning on inviting Eriviar for a visit for a long time, but the ongoing anarchy has made that difficult. Now that things are relatively stable, we shall prepare a festival for the visiting monarch! Among other things Heidenreich has in mind..."
LNS_maar_is_amused:0 "The Old One Laughs"
LNS_maar_is_amused_desc:0 "Maar is amused with the recent development of a relationship between Heidenreich and Eriviar, His acolytes say. He is offering us a boon, but it's a mystery what He can grant us..."
LNS_the_sunstriker_wedding:0 "The Wedding"
LNS_the_sunstriker_wedding_desc:0 ""You are cordially invited to attend the wedding between Eriviar Sunstriker and Rosa Heidenreich, to be joined together at the Brantbeak spires...""
LNS_defenceless_ponies:0 "Easy Prey In The Woods"
LNS_defenceless_ponies_desc:0 "The savage ponies of the north are even less civilized than we are, and we're bandits for Boreas' sake! They only remain free thanks to the protection of the River Coalition. But the eastern ponies are unlikely to intervene if we conduct some small-scale raids and take a little bit of land and loot."
LNS_beasts_of_burden:0 "Beasts Of Burden"
LNS_beasts_of_burden_desc:0 "Now that we've taken some land, we've come to the conclusion that it's damn worthless. But the ponies who live in the forest are quite valuable themselves. To compensate for the losses we took while seizing this land, we will put some of them to work to repay their debt to us."
LNS_mines_of_silverfalls:0 "The Treasures Of Silverfalls"
LNS_mines_of_silverfalls_desc:0 "Most thought that the name "Silverfalls" was just another gaudy and silly pony name, but turns out it is quite fitting. The local waterfalls are glimmering with flakes of silver! The ground must be full of precious ores, unexploited by the barbarians. Now we can exploit it on their behalf."
LNS_enslave_the_illiterate:0 ""Teach" the Illiterate"
LNS_enslave_the_illiterate_desc:0 "The fact is, solving the illiteracy issue in this nation will take too long and will cost too much. Therefore our boss has come up with the idea to simply enslave them all. Anybody who's weighing down our nation shall suffer a slow death in the mines. We can't say we disagree with this methodology."
LNS_massive_drug_fields:0 "아편 밭"
LNS_massive_drug_fields_desc:0 "Regular agriculture takes too long to return its investment. Instead, we'll set up plantations full of drugs! Hedonistic griffons in the Heartlands and beyond pay a pretty coin for them, and we can't let this opportunity slip by our claws."
LNS_imperial_markets:0 "Expanding Our Horizons"
LNS_imperial_markets_desc:0 "Our success in the criminal enterprise has attracted the attention of the organised crime syndicates in the Heartlands. They wish to work with us, so we can become even richer together! We'd be fools to pass this chance up, our coffers could always use more loot."
LNS_despoil_the_land:0 "Despoil the Land"
LNS_despoil_the_land_desc:0 "The common folk will receive a very simple choice - give over anything that has a modicum of value or get shot. Naturally, we'll take their valuables if they resist, but hey, we gave them a fair chance."
LNS_lesson_of_the_reformisten:0 "Lessons of the Reformisten"
LNS_lesson_of_the_reformisten_desc:0 "Certainly, the Reformisten ideology was nebulous and full of holes, but they had some great ideas too. Namely, putting our enemies into forced servitude - we got the guns, and they'll obey our orders, or else..."
LNS_into_the_mines:0 "Into the Mines"
LNS_into_the_mines_desc:0 "It's not enough to just force griffons to serve in our private armies, but we need to have them work in our mines, too. That iron won't dig up by itself, and Boreas knows we need a lot of it for our rifles..."
LNS_an_iron_grip:0 "A Firm Claw"
LNS_an_iron_grip_desc:0 "Our creative methods to solving Longsword's issues are shaping up to be a success. The rebellious nature of the common folk has been finally quashed down for good, and now we rule this land uncontested. This means we're free to expand our operations as Heidenreich sees fit."
LNS_target_practice:0 "A Shooting Competition"
LNS_target_practice_desc:0 "With all the turmoil going on these days, we've found ourselves lacking in things like proper military training and commanders. But we've got a solution for that as well! Hold a shooting contest and conscript the most skilled ones for our warbands. We will provide moving targets."
LNS_organ_donors:0 "Slave Trafficking"
LNS_organ_donors_desc:0 "They say life is the most precious commodity, and this is especially true on the slave market. Slavery might be illegal in most of Griffonia, but that doesn't mean there is no underground market for forced labour. Through our contacts, we may also reach the lucrative slave markets of Zebrica."
LNS_reinvest_our_profits:0 "Reinvest Our Profits"
LNS_reinvest_our_profits_desc:0 "It doesn't take an economic genius to figure out that if we were to invest some of our stolen plunder, we can improve our situation at home drastically, and allow us to perform even better in the future."
LNS_we_are_rich:0 "우리는 부자다!"
LNS_we_are_rich_desc:0 "Some of us had doubts, but Rosa's reign has been nothing but an astounding success. If we knew it would be this easy to become rich, we would have gotten rid of the Count years ago! Our wealth now allows us to increase our nation's standing even more, improving our living standards... If you're one of the bandits, that is. The rest should just be grateful we didn't shoot them. Praise Rosa Heidenreich!"
LNS_legalize_poverty:0 "Deal With the Impoverished"
LNS_legalize_poverty_desc:0 "The poverty in this nation wouldn't be so bad if these lazy griffons got off their rears and started working for a change. Which is exactly what we're going to do - open new factories and politely "suggest" these leeches of society work for whatever we pay them, or else."
LNS_work_programs:0 "빈자들을 위한 작업 프로그램"
LNS_work_programs_desc:0 "Would you look at that, our solution for the chronic poverty is working! Despite the abject working conditions and measly pay check, griffons are lining up to work at whatever we throw at them. Expand our work programs, there's a lot more that needs to be done."
LNS_black_market_arms_industry:0 "Our Spot in the Arms Market"
LNS_black_market_arms_industry_desc:0 "In these current times, you can't toss a rock without finding at least three warmongering nations on Griffonia. And what's more profitable than selling arms? We must seize a piece of this market to increase our profit margins."
LNS_southern_sister:0 "The Southern Sister"
LNS_southern_sister_desc:0 "In the mountains of Blackhollow, a former republican turned warlord has embraced a life of banditry and has built a formidable crime empire. She is known as Blackrock, and has many things in common with Rosa. Perhaps we should conduct an expedition down south and make contact with our fellow bandits?"
LNS_ally_blackrock:0 "Friendship Is Banditry"
LNS_ally_blackrock_desc:0 "Blackrock and Rosa got along quickly, sharing so much in common. Both are disillusioned by the ideologies of misguided griffons. In truth, they don't need any such nonsense. All they need is each other, and together they will fight against the world if they have to."
LNS_split_lushi:0 "Take Lushian Assets"
LNS_split_lushi_desc:0 "The fat nobles down in Lushi are known to be filthy rich. We should deprive them of their wealth! Given their political bickering, we'll be plundering the vaults of Lumium in a week. Hopefully Blackrock will be available to join in on the fun."
LNS_friendship_is_banditry:0 "Safe and Secure"
LNS_friendship_is_banditry_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, there are many who'd want to wipe us off the map. We should look into fortifying our holdings to ensure that anyone invading us has a hard time. We may be bandits, but we're still hardened soldiers and we won't give up so easily."
LNS_girls_night_out:0 "Alcohol Smuggling"
LNS_girls_night_out_desc:0 "With the ongoing political situation across the entirety of Griffonia, it's no surprise griffons and ponies turn to the bottle for comfort. By opening new liquor factories, we'd make a killing selling it! Unfortunately, alcohol trade regulations are strict and thus we must resort to smuggling it. It would be prudent to secure the safety of our runners."
LNS_smuggling:0 "시가 거래"
LNS_smuggling_desc:0 "Following the success of our liquor scheme, we've decided to expand our capacities to produce cigars as well. They might take a few years of your life, but at least you'll die happy. But again, we must expand additional resources into ensuring our illegal drug trade isn't intercepted by the authorities..."
LNS_besties:0 "The Count's Treasure"
LNS_besties_desc:0 "The late Count was, among his other "qualities", quite fond of hoarding stolen wealth from the murdered ponies. He also had a habit of hiding it in remote locations, but Heidenreich has discovered a map of these caches in the Count's study. This plunder will provide us with a great boost towards our goals."
LNS_naniwich_mountain_trip:0 "Poaching"
LNS_naniwich_mountain_trip_desc:0 "The wildlife in these areas is remarkably diverse. But more importantly, all sorts of useful materials can be obtained from hunting animals, such as furs, leathers and much more. These things would be very useful for our soldiers, not to mention the potential sales value. It's not like we care about endangered species, either. More hunting rifles are needed at once!"
LNS_arms_trade:0 "무기 거래"
LNS_arms_trade_desc:0 "There is honour among thieves, certainly, and this has resulted in us making a deal with the other, similarly structured states across Griffonia. By exchanging whatever modern firearm models we come across, we can ensure we're a step ahead of our victims, and continue lining our pockets with plunder. Of course, we'll require some additional factories to produce these new weapons."
LNS_longswordian_dream:0 "The Longswordian Dream"
LNS_longswordian_dream_desc:0 "Our land is a free one, with no laws to bind anyone. Any capable griffon can make a living by exploiting those below him and by participating in the numerous criminal activities taking place in Longsword. Many criminals and bandits persecuted elsewhere now come to us, to our haven of scum and villainy."

LNS_bandit_army_desc:0 ""Listen up, you thugs. If we're going to be rich, you're going to follow my way - disobey me and your body will be in the river by the next hour. Now get your rears to the training grounds.""
LNS_get_guns:0 "Arm the Bands"
LNS_get_guns_desc:0 ""If you don't own a rifle, you're worthless to me. Find a gun, I don't care how you do it, and then get back to me. How do you plan on stealing anything if you don't have a way of protecting yourself?""
LNS_basic_artillery:0 "Bandits With Cannons"
LNS_basic_artillery_desc:0 "It's hard to make a living when our victims hide behind forts and walls. Some improved artillery models should enable us to get back on track. Enemies will cower once they hear the sound of our cannons!"
LNS_pull_out_shovels:0 "Paymasters"
LNS_pull_out_shovels_desc:0 "Scouts, engineers, repairgriffs - we've got them all, but they insist on a special deal if they were to serve us. In exchange for personally paying their subordinates, they want full control of their companies and a cut of the loot. As this suits our overall military strategy, we've agreed to their terms. Support companies are invaluable on the field, after all."
LNS_organize_warbands:0 "Organise the Warbands"
LNS_organize_warbands_desc:0 "We've got a lot of griffons eager to join us, but they see themselves as one griff armies, believing they're invincible just because they have a gun. Some proper organisation will go a long way in making sure we get the most plunder out of each raid, with nobody squabbling over their share."
LNS_appoint_leaders:0 "New Talent"
LNS_appoint_leaders_desc:0 "After the anarchy, we've been left with barely any capable commanders for leading our forces. However, some of the raid leaders have proven themselves skilled, and it would be a shame to have their talent go to waste. Heidenreich will personally promote this new blood."
LNS_personal_armies:0 "Personal Armies"
LNS_personal_armies_desc:0 "With lawlessness and anarchy being the usual state of affairs in Longsword these days, it's no surprise the population has resorted to hiring personal militias and protection squadrons, to protect what little they have. We can use this to our advantage as well, to complement our forces."
LNS_new_tactics:0 "New Formations"
LNS_new_tactics_desc:0 "Our foes fight in disciplined formations and use modern warfare doctrines, so why shouldn't we? We can't expect the prey to just give up their livelihoods, so instead we'll have to work on our tactics, to ensure the best chance of success in the field."
LNS_hit_and_run:0 "Hit and Run Tactics"
LNS_hit_and_run_desc:0 "Most of our griffons are simply not disciplined enough to maintain their battle positions. Incompetence or cowardice, it matters not, for we'll train our armies to continuously harass our victims before retreating, wearing them down. This cycle of pain will continue until they all die, or surrender."
LNS_tank_raiding_brigade:0 "Bandits With Tanks"
LNS_tank_raiding_brigade_desc:0 "Trucks and other similar vehicles make a great getaway option for our warbands, but they're vulnerable against small arms fire. However, if we were to adopt what they call "tank" in the Heartlands, we'd have our protection and a new way to spread terror on our raids."
LNS_baggage:0 "Baggage Slaves"
LNS_baggage_desc:0 "Organising a proper logistical team isn't an option, between all our autonomous, single objective focused armies. Who'd be able to properly supply them, when they're scattered across all directions? Instead, we'll allow the commanders to assign some of the slaves as pack mules, ensuring they are supplied well wherever they go."
LNS_the_apocalypse:0 "Despoiler Brigades"
LNS_the_apocalypse_desc:0 "Now that we've applied the lessons of modern warfare to our raids, it is time to create special divisions, who will be trained specifically in inflicting as much devastation as they can on our prey. Who said banditry didn't pay off? These griffons will steal anything that isn't bolted to the ground."

LNS_bandit_airforce:0 "Bandits In Planes"
LNS_bandit_airforce_desc:0 "The predator lies high on the food chain, and who's more dangerous than us? If we were to invest in creating and maintaining an air force, it would ensure our dominance over our victims... Not to mention raiding would go much quicker from these flying machines."
LNS_fighters:0 "A Pair of Claws"
LNS_fighters_desc:0 "Quick, agile, capable of taking on any plane - the bandits love these fighter planes. Our self-funded pilots have been pressing us to adopt newest fighter designs across the entire nation, so we can have control of the skies at all times."
LNS_heavier_fighters:0 "Talons of Steel"
LNS_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Despite their agility, regular fighters are somewhat frail and require a lot of skill to properly pilot. A heavier fighter model will be the solution to our problems in maintaining air superiority, and they'll be able to better protect our other planes, as well."
LNS_airfields:0 "The Zeltstadt Airfields"
LNS_airfields_desc:0 "Those flygriffs have been begging us to build airfields for months. We've decided to grant their request, if only because we've realised the importance of planes in today's warfare. Not to mention that our raider groups would have more reliable support."
LNS_our_own_doctrine:0 "Altitude Training"
LNS_our_own_doctrine_desc:0 "We've got many volunteers for our air forces, but very few possess the optimal training to handle flying. Our few experienced pilots will be assigned to train as many as they can, developing the beginning of our air doctrine at the same time."
LNS_close_air_support:0 "Up Close and Personal"
LNS_close_air_support_desc:0 "Machine guns and bombs are the ideal instruments of killing, but they're hard to get in proper range on the battlefield. Instead, we'll adapt a fighter model to be more efficient in providing ground support for our forces."
LNS_further_developments:0 "Flight Training Programs"
LNS_further_developments_desc:0 "The initial efforts have paid off, with more and more griffons flocking to become a pilot. The initial wave of recruits have shown promise in handling airplanes, as well, which marks the formation of a professional airforce. Soon enough, our victims won't know what hit 'em!"
LNS_bombers:0 "Explosive Eggs"
LNS_bombers_desc:0 "Explosions! Who doesn't love explosions? Our prey certainly won't once we unveil our new bomber planes, designed to inflict maximum damage on their lands and units..."
LNS_strategic_bombers:0 "Steel Shells"
LNS_strategic_bombers_desc:0 "Conventional bombing does the job well against regular forces, but they don't have the reach or protection to properly assault enemy cities and fortifications. We'll build the biggest, hardest hitting, highest flying bomber yet! Our victims will know their livelihoods are forfeit once these start bombing..."
LNS_ace_fighters:0 "The Black Dozens"
LNS_ace_fighters_desc:0 "Surprisingly, our intense training program has resulted in a formation of a dedicated, passionate group of pilots. Trained in unconventional tactics, they'll be our claws in the sky, striking down any enemy plane, at day or night... Sharing their valuable experience with the other, less trained pilots, as well."
LNS_napalm:0 "Firebombing"
LNS_napalm_desc:0 "Napalm has been denounced as a savage weapon by the civilised western nations, but we hold no such compulsions. If it helps us secure our loot, we'll do it - perhaps our targets will stop resisting so fiercely once they see their precious cities and fields burning..."
LNS_jet_experiments:0 "Bandits With Rockets"
LNS_jet_experiments_desc:0 "Would you look at that? These new rockets leave the current planes in the dust. We should expand our investment in these rockets, they'll give us the fastest and most dangerous weapons in the sky."

LNS_military_victory:0 "Restoration of Order"
LNS_military_victory_desc:0 "Dusktalon may have been deposed, but the country is still wracked and ruined by the years of devastation the Reformisten inflicted on it in their savage goal. We must quickly reassure our people that they have nothing to fear anymore."
LNS_cement_our_rule:0 "Establishing Our Government"
LNS_cement_our_rule_desc:0 "The first order of business is to set up a working, functional government. What existed before was little before than Dusktalon's cronyism on a massive scale, and it showed by their chronic incompetence."
LNS_educate_the_people_military:0 "Education for the Masses"
LNS_educate_the_people_military_desc:0 "Education has been a scarce luxury for a long time in Longsword, mainly because of the Refomisten's seizure of all education material they deemed "corrupted by ponies", which is to say, almost all of it. Schools and libraries will be reopened, and the population will be encouraged to educate themselves."
LNS_address_the_poverty:0 "Help the Impoverished"
LNS_address_the_poverty_desc:0 "For years, the high taxes forced upon by the Reformisten have left the common folk with little more than the clothes on their backs. If we are to have a proper, working nation, the chronic poverty must be addressed through welfare and public works programs."
LNS_status_of_the_ponies_politically:0 "The Rights of Ponies"
LNS_status_of_the_ponies_politically_desc:0 "Ponies shall not be discriminated against and hated anymore! Our laws will be immediately updated to reflect the forming of a new, tolerant society, in which both ponies and griffons can have the same rights and privileges."
LNS_status_of_ponies_as_advisors:0 "Invite Ponies to the Government"
LNS_status_of_ponies_as_advisors_desc:0 "There are many capable, skilled ponies in our country, and it would be a loss for us if we were to disregard their capabilities. To improve the functioning of our nation, and to heal the wounds from the recent blood shedding, the best and brightest will be invited to work for our government."
LNS_land_distribution_to_veterans:0 "Reward the Veterans"
LNS_land_distribution_to_veterans_desc:0 "Those who have risked their lives and more for Longsword shall be properly rewarded, with a sufficient amount of land to sustain themselves. Hopefully, this will also entice more citizens to join our forces, knowing that they will be rewarded at the end of their service."
LNS_connect_the_nation:0 "The Longsword Highway"
LNS_connect_the_nation_desc:0 "The infrastructure has been in a sad state for a long time, between Reformisten negligence and Partisan sabotage. This changes now, and all of Longsword will be properly connected once more."
LNS_industrial_effort:0 "Begin Industrialisation"
LNS_industrial_effort_desc:0 "While the military is a highly important part of our society, of course, we cannot live on bayonets and rifles alone. We shall begin industrialising our country, in order to enable a steady source of employment for our civilians."
LNS_further_industrialisation:0 "More Factories!"
LNS_further_industrialisation_desc:0 "The initial industrial expansion has been a success, and we shall follow up on it by opening more factories and workplaces."
LNS_teach_the_people:0 "New Education Standards"
LNS_teach_the_people_desc:0 "The common folk can only educate themselves up to a certain level. In order to bring our nation to a more contemporary state, we must expand our education centres, open new scientific institutes and invite foreign educators from the Heartlands."
LNS_military_education:0 "Mandatory Basic Training"
LNS_military_education_desc:0 "The world is a dangerous place, and we won't survive for long if we don't institute a mandatory training program for all able-bodied citizens. That way, once the next war inevitably starts, we'll have a large pool of griffons and ponies already fit for recruitment."
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home:0 "Weapons for Everyone"
LNS_a_gun_in_every_home_desc:0 "Freedom cannot be guaranteed without a means to defend it, and the best way to do that is by loosening firearm ownership regulations and providing extra subsidies to weapon manufacturers. An armed society is a safe society."
LNS_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Campaign"
LNS_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "With extensive propaganda efforts, we can show the civilians the glory and honour of serving in our military! Of course, to ensure that they stay in our forces, additional benefits and privileges will be given to soldiers and auxiliary forces."
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans:0 "Incorporate Partisan Tactics"
LNS_lessons_of_the_partisans_desc:0 "Some of the surviving Partisans have expressed interest in serving in our forces. Better yet, they've offered to share their tactics and finesse! Our soldiers will be become even more skilled in every aspect of warfare."
LNS_state_armouries:0 "Firearm Production Expansion"
LNS_state_armouries_desc:0 "All these new recruits will require a lot more equipment than we can currently produce. To solve this, additional factories focused on firearm production will be built, and already existing ones will have their machines upgraded to increase production."
LNS_military_police_f:0 "Militärpolizei"
LNS_military_police_f_desc:0 "To ensure our troops are loyal to the cause, we shall establish a paramilitary force in charge of maintaining discipline, rooting out any traitors or saboteurs, and to spread our carefully woven propaganda. This will ensure our military is one step ahead compared to our foes."
LNS_old_friends:0 "Our Friends in the Empire"
LNS_old_friends_desc:0 "Now that we've restored the proper Longswordian nation, an envoy will be sent to Griffenheim to re-establish our relations with the Empire. They will be happy knowing they can sleep in peace, with the stalwart defenders of the eastern borders preventing any incursions."
LNS_pensions:0 "Military Pensions"
LNS_pensions_desc:0 "Most of our veterans have a difficult time returning to a civilian society, even with their land grants. Many have gone bankrupt or unable to properly feed themselves, and this cannot be allowed. A basic income for our retired troops will be instituted, to properly show our gratitude for their years of service."
LNS_dealing_with_hellquill_military:0 "The Problem of Hellquill"
LNS_dealing_with_hellquill_military_desc:0 "Our northern neighbours in Hellquill have been our staunch allies for a long time, but recent events have mired this longstanding relationship. We must investigate the events and political situation in their lands, and react appropriately."
LNS_bauxite_deposits:0 "Bauxite Mines"
LNS_bauxite_deposits_desc:0 "Large amounts of bauxite have been uncovered while digging for iron in the mines near Zeltstadt. To an average griffon, this sedimentary rock might seem worthless, but from it we can extract precious aluminium, a key component in production of modern airplanes."
LNS_a_proper_nation:0 "A Modern Society"
LNS_a_proper_nation_desc:0 "At last, we have brought Longsword to a modern age. No longer shall the commonfolk remain ignorant and unaware of the world beyond their homes, nor shall we be left behind in the research of newest technologies."
LNS_imperial_volunteers:0 "Imperial Aid"
LNS_imperial_volunteers_desc:0 "Our diplomatic efforts have paid off, and volunteers from the Heartlands have arrived to assist us in holding the border. This is a tremendous help to our efforts."
LNS_shield_of_griffonia:0 "Protectors of Griffonia"
LNS_shield_of_griffonia_desc:0 "With the lands of Hellquill now united with ours, together we shall stand united against any incursions from the eastern ponies. There can be no telling when a radical leader takes over in the Riverlands and decides to wage war on honest living griffons... To this we say, let them come! We shall be prepared for anything, and we shall never falter in our duty!"

LNS_army_creation_neutral:0 "Rebuilding Our Army"
LNS_army_creation_neutral_desc:0 "Dusktalon and his thugs have neglected the proper Longswordian army for too long. No more! We shall rebuild our forces to a more contemporary time while remaining true to the ideals of our honourable ancestors."
LNS_pure_army:0 "Griffons Only!"
LNS_pure_army_desc:0 "The ponies cannot be entirely trusted to serve in our forces. While we have saved them from the clutches of the Reformisten, who's to say they won't turn on us, once their gratitude for us evaporates? No, only griffons will be allowed to serve in the armed forces. They're stronger, they can fly, and don't require specially crafted firearms."
LNS_mixed_army:0 "Allow Recruitment of Ponies"
LNS_mixed_army_desc:0 "We cannot be selective with our recruitment criteria, given our country's small size. Provided they don't cause any trouble, ponies will be allowed to serve side by side with griffons in the defence of Longsword."
LNS_superior_army_1:0 "Feuer und Schwefel"
LNS_superior_army_1_desc:0 "Only through overwhelming firepower can we secure victory. Massing our artillery, improving our firearms, coordination with the air forces - anything and everything to ensure a maximum output of devastation onto the enemy. They won't be able to withstand our barrage."
LNS_mass_army_1:0 "Eine Welle von Körpern"
LNS_mass_army_1_desc:0 "With our current situation, we cannot hope to field armies larger than our current threats. We shall compensate by doubling down on recruitment and mass assault tactics, in order to achieve an approximate parity in military strength."
LNS_mobile_army_1:0 "Gepanzerte Kriegsführung"
LNS_mobile_army_1_desc:0 "Our more traditionalist commanders scoff at the idea, but the reality is that a highly mobile army is the future of warfare. By overrunning our enemies before they can properly react, a swift and decisive victory will be ensured."
LNS_military_industrial_complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
LNS_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "In order to supply our forces with everything they might need, our defence industries and the military will be closely cooperating in opening new facilities and production lines."
LNS_rifle_modernisation:0 "New Guns"
LNS_rifle_modernisation_desc:0 "Our current firearm models are obsolete and prone to frequent breakdowns. This is unacceptable for a militarised society like ours, and to solve this, we shall procure newest models from the Heartlands and beyond."
LNS_proper_trucks:0 "Improved Motorised Models"
LNS_proper_trucks_desc:0 "While the current motorised models are suitable for transporting troops quickly, they cannot quite hold up in a proper fight. Turning them into a light tank variant will ensure our troops can be protected, while maintaining their mobility."
LNS_radio_utilisation:0 "Military Applications of the Radio"
LNS_radio_utilisation_desc:0 "The wonderful invention called the radio has solved many issues we've been facing for ages, but now they must adapted for our usage in armed forces. With it, we can coordinate our assaults and issue requisition orders as soon as needed."
LNS_artillery_military:0 "The Cannons of the Future"
LNS_artillery_military_desc:0 "Our current artillery models are falling apart and cannot keep up with their objectives anymore. New designs will be required that make use of longer barrels, hydraulic recoil devices and lighter but more destructive shells."
LNS_engineer_f:0 "Dedicated Engineer Companies"
LNS_engineer_f_desc:0 "Digging ditches and building makeshift bridges isn't glamourous work, but it is crucial in assisting our forces. Dedicated support squads will be established."
LNS_recon_f:0 "전방 정찰"
LNS_recon_f_desc:0 "전쟁은 단순히 적과 싸우는 것 만이 아니며 항상 우리 앞에 무엇이 기다리는지 알아야 합니다. 준비된 군대가 승리하는 군대입니다."
LNS_light_tanks_military:0 "Initial Armoured Attempt"
LNS_light_tanks_military_desc:0 "It might have seemed like a foolish idea, but placing as armour on a truck and having it be able to withstand small arms assault has shown that there is promise in these tanks. We shall expand on this development, and build proper models soon enough!"
LNS_medium_tanks_military:0 "A Proper Tank"
LNS_medium_tanks_military_desc:0 "Now that our initial efforts have born results, we are free to design a proper battle tank instead of just repurposing a truck or a tractor. They will be the mainstay of our motorised forces."
LNS_magical_rifles:0 "마법의 혁신적 사용"
LNS_magical_rifles_desc:0 "Magic has been a mainstay of our ordinary lives since as long as we can remember, but only recently we've discovered a way to store spells inside magical crystals. With some ingenuity, we can store these crystals in a prototype rifle, and create a much better weapon than current conventional models."
LNS_spec_ops:0 "Dedicated Special Operation Teams"
LNS_spec_ops_desc:0 "In ages past, each knight was an army in itself, being highly independent. Nowadays we can't let individual specially trained troops wander on their own objectives, but instead we shall form entire divisions of these hardy griffons."
LNS_rather_heavy_tanks:0 "Bulldoze Our Enemies"
LNS_rather_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "With our success in designing tanks, we can now apply this knowledge in building the largest and most armoured tanks. No defensive line will be able to withstand their assault."
LNS_rocket_artillery:0 "더 많은 폭발!"
LNS_rocket_artillery_desc:0 "While rocket based artillery is more inaccurate compared to regular towed pieces, they make it up in inflicted devastation. We shall begin including them in our mainstay forces, once the initial designs pass the testing stages."
LNS_special_forces_initiative:0 "Glorify the Elites"
LNS_special_forces_initiative_desc:0 "Our elites are truly the pride of our military! Highly trained and professional, every aspiring regular soldier and civilian wants to be a part of our elite corps. Let us ensure that by expanding our training programs and raising our limits."
LNS_blitzkrieg:0 "Thunderous Warfare"
LNS_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "Our recent innovations in mobile warfare have been a great success, and now we can apply them to all of our forces. They will be able to keep up with our coordinated assault from both air and land."
LNS_Zeltstadt_institute:0 "젤트슈타트 사관학교"
LNS_Zeltstadt_institute_desc:0 "우리는 현대 전쟁술에 대해 많은 것을 배웠지만 우리 군의 장교들과 지휘관들 모두가 이를 숙지했다는 뜻은 아닙니다. 우리 사병들을 교육할 사관학교를 설립해 그들이 전술적 리더십의 선두에 있을 수 있도록 해야 합니다."

LNS_navy_and_airforce_military:0 "The War at Sea and Air"

LNS_air_doctrine_military:0 "Choosing Our Airforce Strategy"
LNS_air_doctrine_military_desc:0 "Our growing air force requires a dedicated doctrine to operate more efficiently. After consulting our production capabilities and available plane models, we shall make the decision for our best choice."
LNS_navy_doctrine_military:0 "Naval Doctrine"
LNS_navy_doctrine_military_desc:0 "Ships require a certain strategy to operate to their fullest, and to achieve that, we must look into existing naval doctrines and adapting the ones that suit our needs the most."
LNS_proper_airbases_military:0 "Hangars for the Planes"
LNS_proper_airbases_military_desc:0 "Enemies can strike with their planes from any direction, and relying on a single base for our planes is risky. Building additional ones will expand our coverage, and ensure our own planes can have multiple bases to refuel from, in case the others are disabled."
LNS_radar_project_military:0 "Improving Our Radar"
LNS_radar_project_military_desc:0 "With the increased reliance on radio communication, a system will be designed to intercept and locate these signals. Radar, as it is called, will ensure we won't be blind from sudden attacks from land, sea or sky."
LNS_home_port_military:0 "Our Home Port"
LNS_home_port_military_desc:0 "A central location from which we shall base our ships and ports must be chosen, in order to smoothen the establishing of our naval forces."
LNS_tac_bomber_focus_military:0 "Tactical Bomber Designs"
LNS_tac_bomber_focus_military_desc:0 "The increasing reliance on fortifications makes it hard for our troops to properly assault enemy positions. Artillery being less effective against these concrete bunkers, we shall instead focus on building bomber airplane models to hit them harder than before."
LNS_strat_bomber_focus_military:0 "Strategic Bomber Developments"
LNS_strat_bomber_focus_military_desc:0 "Many years of fighting has shown that a war can't be won by just killing our enemies, but only by destroying their industry and military bases. Reducing their capabilities to produce firearms will ensure a collapse of their frontlines, and to do that, we shall design our largest bomber model yet."
LNS_fighters_focus_military:0 "Controlling the Skies"
LNS_fighters_focus_military_desc:0 "Each plane in the sky assures our ground forces will have a smoother time. We must look into improving our fighter models, if we want to maintain our superiority."
LNS_close_support_focus_military:0 "Support for the Ground Forces"
LNS_close_support_focus_military_desc:0 "Bombers are expensive to build and maintain, which is why a dedicated fighter model will be made, carrying a similar payload to assist our ground forces in destroying our foes."
LNS_heavy_fighters_focus_military:0 "Heavy Fighter Initiative"
LNS_heavy_fighters_focus_military_desc:0 "While regular fighters are appropriate for contesting the skies, they do not have the range to keep up with our bombers. Larger, more heavily armed and armoured fighters will be made to give our bombers much needed protection."
LNS_plane_factory_military:0 "Kupiškis Institute of Aviation"
LNS_plane_factory_military_desc:0 "The war of air is the war of tomorrow. We cannot afford to ignore this new field of warfare nor can we afford aircraft at all! Having production centres specialised in aircraft fabrication will help lower the cost of these new death machines."
LNS_rocketry_focus_military:0 "Faster than Sound"
LNS_rocketry_focus_military_desc:0 "Our prototype rockets have shown great promise with their speed and ability to carry a destructive payload. Expanding on this, we can produce reliable models that can strike our enemies from vast ranges, with no danger to the lives of our soldiers."
LNS_naval_aviation_military:0 "Bombing their Ships"
LNS_naval_aviation_military_desc:0 "The current ship designs are quite vulnerable towards attacks based from the sky. Our current bomber models do not have the reach for this task, but a specially designed bomber could specialise in this task and secure our control of the seas."

LNS_destroyer_focus_military_desc:0 "Now that we have secured a suitable base of operations, the time has come to take the next step in our efforts to provide a naval shield for the Empire. In order to secure the shipping lanes and hunt potential threat from beneath the waves, we can now focus our efforts on creating more advanced destroyer designs."
LNS_submarine_focus_military:0 "A Subtle Deterrent"
LNS_submarine_focus_military_desc:0 "Submarines might be a dishonourable weapon, but they are excellent at destroying enemy convoys and lone ships, strangling their control of the seas. We must expand our submarine flotilla to ensure our foes cannot wander the seas uncontested."
LNS_cruiser_focus_military:0 "Screens for the Navy"
LNS_cruiser_focus_military_desc:0 "Our continuing efforts to secure the waves for the Empire require us to design larger and more powerful vessels, capable of fending off the assaults of destroyers and other small ships, while remaining fast and maneuverable. These cruiser designs will significantly increase our naval presence."
LNS_battlecruiser_focus_military:0 "A Proper Ship"
LNS_battlecruiser_focus_military_desc:0 "The growth of our naval forces has reached the point where we now feel ready to begin work on capital warships. Fast and well-armed, battlecruisers will allow us to project true power far from land, and mark our transition from a purely defensive stance to having the ability to strike back at menacing foes."
LNS_battleship_focus_military:0 "Floating Fortresses"
LNS_battleship_focus_military_desc:0 "To truly express the grandeur and glory of the Empire on the waves, only one type of warship will suffice: we need battleships. Heavily armed and powerfully protected, these ship will bring us, and the Empire, glory, and strike fear into the hearts of any that dare to challenge our naval mastery."
LNS_expanded_docks_military:0 "Continue Dockyard Expansion"
LNS_expanded_docks_military_desc:0 "Our growing navy requires more production facilities than we currently have. If we want to drastically cut down the construction times for our ships, we must look into expanding our dockyards and ports."
LNS_carriers_focus_military:0 "Union of Sea and Sky"
LNS_carriers_focus_military_desc:0 "Victory on the seas is not determined anymore by who has the most ships, but who can control the skies as well. With convoys adapted to carry fighters and bombers, we shall be able to solidify our grasp on the seas once and for all."
LNS_nuclear_focus:0 "The Ultimate Solution"

LSC_new_arms_industries_desc:0 "During the last few decades weaponry has evolved endlessly. If we wish to persist in this unfair world, we have to move forwards too.

LSC_resource_prospects_desc:0 "There are great mineral riches in Longsword, simply ignored for almost two centuries as our occupants were either too concerned with their crusades and later on attempted genocide to attempt exploiting them for the benefit of all.

LSC_griffon_tech_desc:0 "While during the civil war we were unable to learn the secrets of griffon magic due to how most of partisan griffons were former soldiers or knights, our victory and a wave of new supporters means that we can finally unlock the secrets of griffon magic and how it reacts to pony one."

LSM_assembly_of_knights_desc:0 "While the knights and knightly orders were by far the most politically dominant force in Longsword originally, the Dusktalon line managed to seize much of this power as time went on.

LSM_court_of_commoners_desc:0 "While the noble tradition of knighthood makes knights far more suitable to rule and command, they are not suitable to fix issues faced and limited to commoners. It only makes sense to give the common folk a way to solve problems unworthy of knightly consideration."
LSM_devolution:0 "Devolution of Powers"
LSM_devolution_desc:0 "For most of the history of Longsword, any sort of central governance was impossible due to technological hurdles, thus knights took over such duty.

LSM_komtur_system:0 "Modernize the Komtur System"
LSM_komtur_system_desc:0 "During the golden years of our order, knight commanders were responsible for even the most local governance, production of material and defence.

LSM_patronage_arts_sciences:0 "Patronage of Arts and Sciences"
LSM_patronage_arts_sciences_desc:0 "We are no uncultured barbarians, nor do we oppose progress.

While the system of patronage might have collapsed elsewhere, that won’t happen here."
LSM_warrior_peasantry:0 "Wehrbauers"
LSM_warrior_peasantry_desc:0 "For all of our history, we were under threat of potential eastern invasion.

LSM_smalltime_industry:0 "Promote Smalltime Industry"
LSM_smalltime_industry_desc:0 "While large magnates are corrupt degenerates and the workers of large industrial complexes often turn to revolutionary insanity, that doesn’t mean industry is inherently evil.

LSM_pale_of_settlement_desc:0 "We do not seek to destroy the ponies, but as the Pliaters and Tyzenhauzens have shown, pony faith and influence corrupts the faithful.

LSM_modernization_of_agriculture_desc:0 "Longsword was and still is an agrarian state dominated by old methods of land working.

LSM_reenactments_desc:0 "An unused blade rusts and becomes blunt. It’s the same with the knights who wield it.

LSM_landtag:0 "Restore the Tradition of Landtags"
LSM_landtag_desc:0 "The Komturs and the Ritterschaftsausschuss are not enough for proper governance of a realm as diverse in conditions, religious, racial composition and knightly influence as Longsword.

LSM_new_state_organization_desc:0 "The history of local governance and organization in Longsword is chaotic to say the absolute least, often done by nobility and knights.

LSM_young_griffs_desc:0 "The Wandervögel, or 'wandering birds', are a youth movement which call for a return to simple rural life and exhibit this goal by organizing hiking trips and youth communes.

LSM_military_pensions:0 "Reform the Military Pension System"
LSM_military_pensions_desc:0 "Support for radicalism rises from anger over inadequate conditions. This became especially notable as many of our former veterans aligned with the partisans due to inadequate pensions and lack of respect. If they are provided proper pensions for their lifestyles, they will not cause issues."
LSM_military_police:0 "Militärpolizei"
LSM_military_police_desc:0 "Before and during the Bloodbath, the police was subverted and radicalised by the Reformisten.

LSM_pony_suffrage_desc:0 "Within Longsword, ponies are half of the population which was historically oppressed and denied denied self-governance and many rights.

LSM_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "Constructing a bill of rights that respects and defends two radically different races, cultures and faiths will be difficult, but that is the only way.

LSM_fight_extremism_desc:0 "While the military didn’t succumb to Reformisten insanity or partisan radicalism, there are still many extremists and opportunists who aligned with us due to rivalries and not actual beliefs. We will not allow these elements to persist and corrupt us from within."
LSM_engelberg_government:0 "The First Engelberg Government"
LSM_engelberg_government_desc:0 "Longsword has been stabilized, and General Silvertalon is now ready to return the instruments of governance to Solarpluff Engelberg.

LSM_balanced_personhood_desc:0 "Our populace is too influenced by foreign ideas and foreign radicalism to understand their own local character and what it requires. Sadly, it seems we will be the ones who have to teach them to understand the unique Longswordian character and what a Longswordian person is."
LSM_military_governments:0 "Local Military Governance"
LSM_military_governments_desc:0 "It seems yet again the duties of the military are increasing as we are forced to replace the self-interested and too influenced by foreign ideas civilian administration. At least this way we can ensure that a truly apolitical force is in charge."
LSM_authority_structure:0 "Hierarchy of Authorities"
LSM_authority_structure_desc:0 "The easiest way to establish an idea among the populace is to allow it to seep down from top to bottom. This can be achieved through more defined hierarchies of power. Thus, to teach the populace we will be porting the stricter military structure to the civilian sector to promote the idea of balanced personhood."
LSM_moral_education:0 "Moral Education"
LSM_moral_education_desc:0 "Adults are too set in their ways to properly change their viewpoints into something more useful or positive, they will bend, but not break. The younger generation on the other claw, can be taught better ideas and values and will truly believe in them."

LSM_advisory_councils_desc:0 "The businessgriffs of Longsword have too much power to be allowed to go on unsupervised.

LSM_foster_new_culture_desc:0 "While we do not desire to destroy the past and force everyone to forget it, the cultural values of both Longswordian griffon and pony, based greatly on conflict between these groups must be forgotten and something new and truly representing all Longswordians must take place. "

LSM_ideological_study_circles_desc:0 "While foreign ideologies are often a negative influence as many of them subvert the idea of national character, that doesn’t mean their study should be forbidden. But we should always remind our citizens that while those ideas might sound good, national character should always be considered."
LSM_form_the_castle:0 "Establish the Schlosstreue"
LSM_form_the_castle_desc:0 "It seems that finally, the wounds are slowly healing. Many military and civilian figures are now ready to truly work and fight for the true ideal of Longsword. Hopefully, this means that someday we can be but the "Castle" party within a democratic and prosperous country and not a military regime."
LSM_no_mercy:0 "No Mercy"
LSM_no_mercy_desc:0 "The weeks after the failure of our first republican attempt revealed an ugly truth as many movements and groups, thought as non-functional or gone, reappeared and began enacting their brutal ways again.

LSM_crack_down_on_reformisten_desc:0 "Somehow, despite all that was done, the curse of Reformisten still persists within our state.

LSM_crack_down_on_partisans_desc:0 "Most partisans surrendered and integrated back into society when they were defeated.

LSM_burn_forests:0 "Burn the Forests"
LSM_burn_forests_desc:0 "Both the reformisten and partisan remnants persist mostly in our great forests, battling each other across the wilderness while also seeking to seize leadership.

LSM_secret_police:0 "Secret Police"
LSM_secret_police_desc:0 "Their supporters are imprisoned and their forces are truly crushed, yet the radical ideologies seem to persist as whispers of totalitarian ideals spread through shady bars and hidden basements.

LSM_contitution_novelization:0 "Novelization of the Constitution"
LSM_contitution_novelization_desc:0 "One cannot dismiss the fears that either the civil war or radical activity will resume again in the future.

LSM_cartelization:0 "Promote Cartelization of Industry"
LSM_cartelization_desc:0 "If two companies compete in the same field and both spend two million bits on marketing their product, that is four million bits which could have been spent on making products for society and yet were wasted.

LSM_rural_education:0 "Kirchspiels Schulverwaltung"
LSM_rural_education_desc:0 "It does not matter if the middle classes of Swordsson and Zeltstadt are well-off and educated.

To amend that, we must implement a decentralized system of education and mandate the establishment of grammar schools for every 500 inhabitants."
LSM_fight_poverty:0 "Relief for the Impoverished"
LSM_fight_poverty_desc:0 "The civil war left many destitute, homeless and on the verge of starvation. We cannot leave themm behind - no matter what their race is, they are still Longswordian.

LSM_railroad_construction:0 "National Infrastructure Commission"
LSM_railroad_construction_desc:0 "The civil war left many roads and rail lines unusable - and even if that were not the case, the infrastructure system in the country has become hopelessly outdated.

LSM_knighthood_industry:0 "Ritterschafts Güterkommission"
LSM_knighthood_industry_desc:0 "While few are aware of this, many knightly orders participate in economic activity to fund their armed forces - the Rosewood Order is no exception.

LSM_urbanization:0 "Urban Development"
LSM_urbanization_desc:0 "Swordsson and other cities are the key part of Longsword's economy, and to ensure that more hooves and claws are available to work in city industries, we must establish incentives for urban immigration and push more peasants to move to cities."

LSM_mission_tactics:0 "Auftragstaktik"
LSM_mission_tactics_desc:0 "Planning is indispensable, but plans are useless.

Our soldiers must receive specific tasks and learn to adapt to the local situation in order to accomplish them."
LSM_arms_concentration_doctrine:0 "Schwerpunkt Principle"
LSM_arms_concentration_doctrine_desc:0 "In an enemy line, not all spots are equally important.

LSM_magical_brigades:0 "Unicorn Conscription"

LSM_civilian_auxiliary:0 "Form Civilian Auxiliaries"
LSM_civilian_auxiliary_desc:0 "We should not hold the illusion that Rosewood Knights, no matter how well armed, can win battles alone - there simply aren't enough of them.

longsword.1.d:0 ""환영합니다, 동지들", 스타리 나이트는 작은 외딴 숲에서 그녀의 혁명가 동지들에게 말했습니다. "모두가 무사히 도착해서 정말 기쁘군요. 오늘 모임을 소집한 이유는 늘어나는 검은망토들의 위협에 대한 행동 계획을 논의하기 위해서입니다. 하루도 빠짐없이 마을이 불타고 가족들이 학살당하고 강에 시체들이 떠내려온다는 소식이 들려옵니다! 너무도 오래 이런 일이 지속되었는데 우리가 어찌 해야 하겠습니까?" \n\n"우리는 저항하고, 싸우고 물어뜯을 것이다!" \n\n"동지들이여 영광을!", 스타리는 다시 말을 이었습니다, "지금 이 순간에도 헬퀼과 레이크 시티의 친우들이 우리를 도우러 오고 있습니다! 더스크탈론과 그 일당들은 더이상 무고한 포니들을 해치지 못할 것입니다! 새로운 새벽이 밝아 오고 우리 모두 자유가 될 겁니다!". 모여있던 파르티잔들은 이에 환호하며 발굽을 내려칩니다. 오랜만에 그들의 눈에 희망의 빛이 반짝였습니다. 모두 앞으로의 일들에 대비되어 있을 겁니다."

"좋습니다. 우리가 떠나기 전에 두마디만 하고 싶군요. 첫째로, 이 어렵고 위험한 임무를 저와 함께 하기로 결정하신 것에 대해 여러분 모두에게 감사드립니다. 둘째로, 우리가 백작의 병사들과 마주칠 일은 없을 테지만, 어둠 속에서 그리폰들은 우리 중 누구보다 시야가 뛰어나기에 경계를 늦추면 안됩니다. 그러니 이동할때 소음에 주의해 주시기 바랍니다. 괜히 주변의 관심이라도 끌게 되면 좋을게 없으니까요." 당신은 심호흡을 하고 마음을 다잡습니다.

You advanced through the wilderness until it was safe to assume that even the most keen-eyed griffons couldn't see your movement. From here on, your journey should be far safer as Kupiškis was the last urban centre with any substantial presence of griffon military forces in your path.

Of course, your group didn't emerge out of the firefight completely without harm, with a few suffering minor wounds from bullets scrapping their bodies while one of the partisans was shot in their right front leg. You patched her wound up in the best way you could afford with the limited time you had. While others suggested to only help her after reaching safety, you decided that you wouldn't risk the guards finding you due to the mare's blood. Only after you were sure that there wasn't a way that the griffons could track your group, you ordered them to run. \n\nWhile you couldn't spend much time in Kupiškis, it was enough to get some proper sleep, some good food and to bandage the wounds that the other partisans suffered properly. Now they wouldn't fall off and yesterday's situation wouldn't repeat again, hopefully.\n\nAs the group was about to leave, you turned to the owners of the apartment. \n\n"Thank you for taking us in."

And what few schools existed were in a horrible shape and lacked funding. Our ministry of education had to start from scratch. And with dedication from ponies and griffons working in the institution, we are seemingly moving forwards. The old schools are being renovated and new ones are being built monthly. The old curriculum has been discarded completely, replaced by a new one which consists of courses which are deemed necessary to create an educated and capable society, which includes basic literacy, history and basic military training, among various other subjects.\n\nOf course, it will take a substantial amount of time before this reform is completed, but it already seems that we are slowly reaching positive results."

Previously, it was a country plagued by illiteracy, its leaders obsessed with delusions of grandeur rather than actually caring for the citizens. However, with the efforts of our ministry of education this has changed. New schools have been built, new, professional teachers have been trained, an improved curriculum has been implemented and tens of thousands of books have been printed. And this has great results as literacy rates are rising at an astonishing rate. Of course, it will still take us years if not decades to reach complete literacy.

Some suggest that we should try to achieve the union of our countries diplomatically. They argue that a country built on war and destruction would be extremely unstable and prone to internal conflicts.

They are the corruption destroying us from within," Count Dusktalon droned on and on, "I need you to make our dream a reality." Silvertalon, realising his efforts were in vain, gave a quick salute and left the room. The Count was worse than a brick wall! Nothing he said got to him! \n\nAs he was leaving the Count's residence, flanked by the Reformisten guards, he heard a pony screaming. Silvertalon closed his eyes and sighed. He had no real love for the ponies, but it was obvious slaughtering them senselessly would cause an even bigger disaster later on! \n\nIt was time to stop this madness. And he knew that he would not be alone. Throughout the past few weeks, he had been corresponding with an ally in Zeltstadt - the Rosewood Order. Hochmeisterin Konrada and the honorable knights who had fought alongside Grover in the crusade to the East, they saw no need for this bloodshed.\n\nTogether, they would have to return and topple the Count.

From what she heard of her fellow conspirator, Conrad Silvertalon, the Army was being pressured to lend their support as well.\n\nThis simply would not stand. Having thrown the letter to the fireplace, she set forth on writing her own, more beneficial orders. The Rosewood Order would be moving a slight few pieces to...create some alterations in the schedule. A few slight nudges here and there could go a long way towards making sure that the Count's plans would go slighty awry and go into a tailspin."

longsword.45.t:0 "The Reformisten in the Army"
longsword.45.d:0 "Many of the high positions in the Longswordian army have been occupied by Dusktalon's Reformisten goons, and their effect is starting to show. They're nothing but cruel taskmasters, disregarding their responsibilities, murdering innocent civilians and stealing their subordinates' pay checks. \n\nGeneral Silvertalon and his conspirators have been investigating them and has been coming up with plans to get Dusktalon's sycophants safely out of the way before they can cause too much trouble for the conspiracy. Either quietly kill them and dispose of the bodies somewhere discreetly, or, alternatively, send them on a very special mission to Visaginas and other pony-majority areas where the partisans would probably be more than happy to take quite a lot of potshots at them, solving two problems at once."

The complete incompetence of the officers has led to a massive rout, with many wounded griffons returning to Swordsson. Count Dusktalon was furious and will undoubtedly sack the griffons responsible for this failure. \n\nFor all Dusktalon knows, the Army has been nothing but loyal and has evaded the blame for sending the soldiers to Varėna, which has had a good bouquet opened amongst the senior members of the Order to toast to their victory. The Reformisten's defeat has further Silvertalon's plans."

Although both sides have taken heavy casualties, and isolated city sections are still occupied by the Partisans, this is a clear victory for the Reformisten. Count Dusktalon has issued minor rewards to the surviving officers for their courage and bravery and is expected to visit their quarters back in Swordsson personally in a few days. \n\nThe Rosewood Order and General Silvertalon have both begrudgingly expressed praise for the victorious griffons and their valour at arms against the enemies of the state."

They were forced to give up quickly and flee into the forests, and now the Reformisten flag proudly flies from the town hall's spire. Count Dusktalon has promoted the leading commander of the mission with decorations and medals and hass called him and his unit "Heroes of Longsword". The Prelate has ordered a day of celebration in force of this victory \n\nPrivately, the Rosewood Order and General Silvertalon have been fuming behind the scenes, the gamble on sending them away failing miserably.

The official reasoning by the military and the government was "to protect the Order's castles from the partisan danger", but the civilians are somewhat doubtful of the truthfulness in this claim. Nonetheless, they welcomed the added degree of protection, including bunkers and hidden defences ready to be deployed at a moment's notice. \n\nOf course, the loyalists have been fully aware of the purpose of these defences... If we can't take Longsword from Dusktalon, we'll outlast him until he has starved to death."

Unfortunately, if we were to take everything, this would undoubtedly alarm the Reformisten to a conspiracy and that someone would is moving against them in places unseen. \n\nAfter deliberations within the order, it has been decided that the loss of half of the shipment would be attributed to a partisan raid on one of the few rail lines - but which half shall we take for ourselves?"

The normally incompetent Count, however, has recently delegated the factory supervision to his frightening and capable second-in-command, Rosa Heidenreich. She is...something else entirely and won't be so easily fooled. Perhaps, if Silvertalon and Wavewing's conspiracy pays her a visit in person and explains a few things about Dusktalon, she will see the light and work with us in the future."

The Count is an illegitimate ruler who has no love for the people, nor does he care about Longsword. He has committed crimes that disgust every good griffon, no matter creed or origin! We invite every willing griffon and pony to join us in Zeltstadt, so we can restore true values to Longsword!" \n\nThe message spread throughout Longsword, and has sent ripples through the country.

This is an obstruction to our plan of restoring the proper Longswordian nation, but the Hochmeisterin has been optimistic and ensured General Silvertalon that the Order can handle fighting a war on two fronts if we adequately prepare..."

longsword.54.d:0 "This morning, the population of Longsword has awoken to a gruesome sight - griffon bodies lying in the street, shot in their homes and workplaces by assassins unknown, all across Longsword. However, it was quickly realized that all these griffons were connected to the hateful Reformisten, whether they were full members or voluntary collaborators. The common griffons and ponies did not intervene as they watched this vigilante justice sporadically continue to be meted out for the rest of the day. \n\nSurprisingly, the Count hasn't issued a reprisal or action against this open rebellion. Perhaps he was fearful of what goes bump in the night. Or day. The Rosewood Order's reach is vast, and has only grown larger in recent weeks."

While everygriff is of the opinion to divert some of our resources and soldiers into harassing the partisans, there is no clear consensus on where we should strike to take the initiative once the real fighting breaks out. Should we order our soldiers to raid towns and villages known to be hotbeds for partisan activity to hamper their recruitment once the inevitable confrontation happens, or send saboteurs to their camps containing their precious stockpiles of weapons and explosives?"

The madgriff of Longsword hides in his city, fearful of our retribution. For too long has this unwarranted butchery been allowed to continue. But we say no! We will go against him and restore honor and dignity to Longsword today and tomorrow!

longsword.57.d:0 "Conrad Silvertalon and Konrada Wavewing stood in Swordsson's central square, now filled with rubble after heavy artillery bombardment. After a hard and brutal fight, the civil war for Longsword has been finally concluded in their favour. The Reformisten did not go down easily, as they used some truly despicable tactics, such as arming innocent griffon civilians and pretending to surrender numerous times. The mad Count himself was found barricaded in his residence, and was dragged out to the streets after a short struggle. He was summarily executed by the firing squad, screaming insults and curses as his last words. \n\nMeanwhile in the countryside, the remaining Partisans have agreed to peacefully surrender in exchange for amnesty. Their request was granted as they were fighting for their very existence - a just and noble endeavour, but now they've seen that they cannot bring their idea of change to Longsword after our victory. It will take a while to repair relations between griffons and ponies, following the years of sustained violence against the innocent ponies. \n\nSilvertalon addressed his griffons and ponies, telling them how proud he was of their courage in standing to up the cruel Reformisten, and finished by saying that our victory marks the beginning of a new age for a honourable Longsword, defender of the griffon way of life. Wavewing's address afterwards was a lot more brief, a statement of only a few words that they can all be proud of their achievement."

An updated curriculum consisting of basic literacy skills, physical education, and our great Empire's politics and history has been designed and distributed to the few schools dotted around nation, with new schools being built by the month. \nThough progress has been almost painfully slow, the program is finally starting to bear fruit. Our officers no longer have to deal with the troubles of teaching new recruits how to sound off in order, or properly grip a rifle, saving us a lot of time and heartache. \n\nNow only if they'd point those rifles in the right direction..."

Our one-griffon education department has even conducted a surprise inspection of a school in our capital, and to their surprise, the students could disarm an armed assailant from over 20 meters away, accurately describe most events in the Empire's history, and some could even count to a hundred! Detractors of the program are now completely silent on the topic, if not coming out in support of the program - it seems like they've finally seen reason.

Apparently foil-wrapped chocolate bits can look very similar to the real thing. Very, very similar. \nThe subsequent investigation has revealed many deep-rooted issues within our economy, namely a people almost entirely dependent on unstable subsistence farming, the total stagnation of monetary flow between businesses, and the inability to requisition any funding from the general population for lack of any funds to requisition. Not to mention, Dusktalon and his Reformisten cronies had been seizing, without justification, the money and property of the populace for years... \nAn emergency policy meeting has resulted in a new plan of constructing additional military outposts to secure trade routes, importing foreign machinery to supplement our meagre industrial base, and adding a new agricultural service requirement to our national conscription terms. \n\nBoreas, let's hope this works."

longsword.61.d:0 "News!

Villages are alive with the sounds of industry, markets are bustling and open for business, and for once in a long, long time, our nation can expect to come home to a warm meal after a hard day's work. \nAnd while we're still stuck growing wheat in gravel, at least now we won't have to dig the holes with our bare claws. \n\nThat's progress, right?"

They refuse to accept their proper place, they refuse to acknowledge the superiority of the Griffon race! We cannot realise our full potential with their kind around, they must all be put to the sword!" \n\nAs his speech concluded, the riled up Reformisten began screaming for death to all the ponies and fired celebratory shots from their rifles to the sky.

These oversized rats have no place here, after all. However, trouble in paradise has reared its ugly head as regular patrols and even training exercises have ended in deadly accidents for our new officers.\n\nBe it a patrol ending with some vile bandits, or lone communists shooting an officer dead, or a mortar test fire going way off trajectory and killing some key personnel, there have been some sketchy incidents happening.

For all their effort, Starry Night and most of the Partisans were able to flee across the border to Lake City, their escape covered by ponies and griffons who sacrificed themselves to enable it. In the end, it could reasonably be said not a single pony was left in Longsword. \n\nAfter all these years, setbacks and outright revolts, Count Pallas Dusktalon considered his dream fulfilled. Sure, he had to destroy most of the country to accomplish that, but did that matter once von Katerinburg learned of his success? Surely he'd get richly rewarded, maybe even gain a higher title! Now all that's left is for Rosa Heidenreich to send the letter to Hellquill, reporting of their success. \n\nOn the other claw, Rosa herself was feeling disillusioned by this outcome.

The country is ruined, we went too far and accomplished nothing worth boasting about. It is time for you to step down", disappointment clear in her tone. \n\nThe nerve of this griffon! He has achieved his dream and so much more, and now she wants to throw it all away?! He stood up and started screeching: "Heidenreich, how dare you interfere in our sacred du-", but he didn't get to finish as one of the conspirators shot him in the head. \n\nWord of this event quickly spread, and anarchy ensued as the Reformisten turned on each other in brutal infighting.

Her genuine belief in its movement served well in having her climb up to the top with ease. The last thing she'd have thought is how its rise ultimately led to the fall of Longsword as a nation state - a civilized one at least. She was to be an upstanding lady of the nation! Now her days were spent living off the work of others she'd stolen from. Of all things she thought she'd be as a small girl, being a leader of bandits wasn't even a consideration. \n\nThis had gone on for months now, weeks of pointless existence off of the backs of others weaker than her. It was... emotionally grating, demoralizing even. Nothing impressed her anymore and life had come to a standstill even as it continued on.

Such things often led to less-than-pleasant outcomes, but instead she and her underlings ran into the monarch of the neighbouring mountainous Sunstriker clan, Eriviar. He had consensually pursued a far more violent and passionate path in his life as well, in his pursuit of the Griffon God, Maar. Such deeds led him to continue the outdated lifestyle of raiding one's neighbours for desired goods. Of all birds Rosa could've run into, Eriviar near instantly became one she'd not forget. His forces were nearly the same size and similarly equipped if not worse off, yet his troops had garnered twice as much loot as she had. She knew well that she had caught his eye, considering it was he who insisted on stopping to converse to profess interest in her, along with giving Rosa a quarter of his own loot as a show of good faith.

Life after his eye opening coma had been hurried and busy. No time to look over the little things, such as the matters of his heart. His eyes had always been on that the state and his worship of Maar, the being who'd made his path clear for his clan. But this girl of Longsword? This Rosa? She was something else, so beautiful and strong! Her last name... what was it? Heidenreich? Even a name such as that carried power with it! Eriviar's mind had become consumed with thoughts of this girl. So much infatuation... he had to release it all somehow, otherwise Maar may smite him for his lack of faith with his mind elsewhere constantly. \n\nHe took to solving this dilemma in the form of letter writing. In words he described all the feelings he'd possessed lately regarding Rosa, be it admiration, romantic want, or anything else that came to mind. He cared not for fear of rejection, simply to ease himself of these emotions he'd gained. Much to his surprise the letter he'd sent was soon returned with a response from Rosa. One that was not negative in the slightest, while perhaps not nearly as emotional as his own, the beautiful griffon had written of her interest in him. Perhaps Eriviar has found the only other being who could ever exist in his heart alongside Maar..."

Eriviar couldn't get the girl out of her head ever since returning home after running into her just a few weeks prior. Up until this point he'd been so focused on his purpose in creating a better life for the members of his clan. But never did he take a step back to think of what would be best for himself. This included his complete abandonment of doing anything leisurely for himself, for the greater good of the country... By extension he'd lived quite the lonely existence. He had no time to even entertain his passing urgess on some fair maiden, the King had been utterly chaste! His mind never dwelled into such matters... at least until meeting this bird of Longsword - what's left of it at least. \n\nHe couldn't help himself but take to the pen and paper to describe the feelings he'd been having. The sensations which Rosa was now causing him to have just by the very thought of her! He couldn't care for the idea of this backfiring or being rejected, he needed it out of his system. He needed to tell her, and he finally needed to know how she felt in return. The end result was nothing less than what the King could've asked for when he received a response detailing Lady Heidenreich's mutual acceptance of such romantic interest.

Rosa's repeated replies to his own letters of desire had given the male a boost to his confidence to boot. He'd always been confident but knowing even in the romantic field he held prominence?

Enough so that after receiving his latest gift she was driven to preparing a great feast for him to partake in. In fact the feast became a front of her ultimate plan of tying the knot with him. She smirked at her joke. Nothing better than alcohol, food, and party games to get a male relaxed enough for intimacy. Initially sure, Eriviar wanted her... but now? Rosa NEEDED him.

Rosa had taken a liking to Eriviar... perhaps as much as he'd taken to her. This was obviously the case, as during the festivities she simply couldn't keep her eyes off him, and refused to be away from him for long. Eriviar appreciated... nay, basked in the attention. That, alongside showing off in the competitions he'd partake in, the young King even winning the shooting contest. Though as the night went on Eriviar soon found himself... alone with just the pretty Longswordian. It was here he was asked quite the loaded question by Rosa.

Initially his advisors would've felt she'd be nothing more than a cash sink that'd eventually burn Eriviar emotionally when she'd extracted enough value out of him. But they all grew quiet when it was she who offered to invite him to Longsword for a leisure trip. Some remained sceptical of the King's trip to a bandit country but... considering Rosa's reputation it'd be unlikely anyone would try offending her - especially on her own home turf. His arrival was greeted warmly by all those involved, and especially warmly by Rosa in the form of a hug and quite the bold peck on the beak. Griffons might've not been able to kiss like equines did, but the touching of beaks established the symbolism of it. \n\nEriviar embraced the attention wholeheartedly. He had little complaints of Rosa's overly warm advances or the fact she'd practically been hanging on his wing the whole evening. The girl shameless showed off her apparent attraction to Eriviar at this point - it wasn't like her underlings were going to poke fun... not without risk of losing their tongues. The festivities lasted far into the evening... though eventually Eriviar found himself alone with his lady Heidenreich. Less than a minute passed and already the two held each other's claws warmly. Eyes connecting with the oncoming silence speaking just as loud as words could. Eventually Rosa broke the silence to speak. "Mead in my room, Milord?", with the ever telling wink.

Despite Longsword's reputation to outsiders, the little devilish griffoness had created quite the comfy home for herself in the capital's remnants. Of all the surrounding desolation her headquarters and de facto "Palace" provided any comfort one could expect in more civilized countries. Lady Heidenreich's room was no different as it possessed an overly luxurious bedding she'd no doubt stolen from some poor Firtreeian pony or Griffonian noble along with plentiful furniture. Even if she had to work like a low-class ruffian she sure strived to live like an upper-class lady of stature now. She'd dress like one too... privately and publicly when viable. \n\nEriviar soon learned of this as he entered his lady's room first and followed her simple orders to get comfortable. He undressed some, merely taking off his dress jacket to hang it up before moving to sit down atop the head of her large bedding. It'd be less than a minute or so before the blue-eyed beauty returned in... quite the scanty array of lingerie. It was definitely something fabricated in Skyfall by the looks of it, the fanciful black silk leaving little to the imagination. The sight of a female flaunting her body like that caused a blush to form on Eriviar's cheeks. "Milord." She hummed forebodingly, Eriviar's heart rate was quick to ramp up. He'd believed he'd be drinking mead, however... another one of his desires would be fulfilled instead. Something that'd been on his mind for quite some time."

How lucky was he to have a pure Longswordian lady such as she offer to commit to such crass deeds - and still he declined! Rosa initially attempted to force a smile that became increasingly awkward. But barely a minute passed before the façade broke and she brazenly smacked King right on the cheek. Eriviar was shocked and stunned as it occurred. "Fiend! You lead me on like this for what? What a waste!" She exclaimed and stormed off from him, he couldn't tell if she'd be choking back tears or not as she did. But for what it was she was pissed at him. Had he really been that lustful as to give this griffoness such sultry signals? Perhaps he was at fault for this... but he couldn't know, Rosa had already stormed off to be alone. Hopefully this wouldn't escalate further... the circumstances were private, after all. The two can still be adults about state affairs... right?"

"Oh my lovely Eriviar, I know it is so early into our romance but I believe you are the one! I've not held so much love and desire for another in the few decades I've lived, surely you feel the same? It's only fitting we bind our souls together eternally in marriage!" The written words burned themselves into Eriviar's retinas... things had progressed so fast and now it was out of his control! Is this really what he wanted? Though...at the same time it was flattering that it was her who did more of the heavy lifting. She knew what she wanted...and what she wanted was him, but was she who HE wanted?"

She got along well with all of them, only reinforcing her position as the King's perfect bride. She'd sent out some of her goons weeks in advance to the West to seek some fanciful wedding gown directly from the stores of Skyfall and they'd arrived on time for today as well. A bit rushed to fit everything but nothing impossible... and really she did look beautiful. She hadn't often worn white but in an event like this a lady such as herself shouldn't go outside the norm. The day was a haze for her as things progressed quickly, she was a schoolgirl once more with how giddy she'd be!

Two of Rosa's attendants spoke between themselves as they delivered the King's response to Rosa's bold marriage. They'd managed to open it flawlessly and read the answer ahead of time before delivering the letter with their boss likely to never know. The answer was a stoic and cruel decline from him. After all the letters they'd share and recent time they'd had with one another, it'd been for naught. Mere seconds after the two had spoken to one another they'd hear a loud "WHAT?!" in quite the high pitched voice crack from within Rosa's room. She now knew the King's answer and... very obviously she wasn't happy in the slightest. "Go. GO!" One of the two spoke in a hurried and anxious whisper as they each abandoned their posts to be as far away from the bombshell brewing in that room. The two felt plenty bad for whoever might cross her path in the coming hours... or weeks to come. As they left they could hear a mirror shatter faintly behind her closed door, one could say lady Heidenreich wasn't taking this too well."

He'd accepted the proposal happily and scattered to find a proper engagement band and later wedding ring to give his betrothed. Not to mention gathering the members of his family in the isolated mountain ranges of his nation... and finding a place to hold the ceremony... and... and... the poor fellow had quite the workload. It quickly became apparent that running a nation wasn't nearly as difficult as organizing a wedding. Maybe it was just the expectations and anxiety of having to impress Rosa one last time. Things had to be perfect otherwise maybe she won't want him anymore! Of course chances are Rosa wouldn't be so petty but... he couldn't risk the odds. When the day finally came the only smile Eriviar could manage was a forced one, unlike Rosa, who'd been grinning like a giddy schoolgirl the whole time. Only when the procession finally came and the two stood before the altar did Eriviar finally relax. His face softening into a genuine smile as he turned to face his eternally beloved.

Throughout time, the naturalistic faith of the Longswordian ponies gravitated closer to Archonism, adopting some of their deities and practices. The Posniaks went even further, accepting the griffon pantheon almost completely and crafting a unique culture throughout centuries. Nowhere else will this nature reflect more than in a new pantheon for their people.\n\nA mass campaign of religious clarification has begun and the old temples have been seized to preach a new set of gods. Centered around the merged goddess of Varėnė-Arcturia, the new Longswordian pantheon proclaims that the faith of the ponies of the past was somewhat misled, for they focused too much on each other instead of recognizing that the same gods blessed their griffon neighbours. All deities aside for them are not truly divine - the traditional Riverlander beliefs worship demigods born from Varėnė-Arcturia, and the Alicorns are merely magical ponies who received blessings from her. Old traditions are being disassembled, replaced by new religious holidays, observations and practices, mandatory to attend for every citizen. The remnants of the Kriwe class, understandably, disagreed, and many of them outright refused to abide by this newly constructed Longswordian faith, declaring it heretical and an affront to the gods. For standing against destiny, they have been dealt with violently."

Under his regime, Griffon culture is being stamped out, replaced by an unnatural mix of the traditions of both species, in name of an indescipherable higher ideal. [From.GetName] has chosen to rise against it and defend the pride of the Griffons, and their diplomats are on our doorstep, calling us to join the crusade. What shall we do?"

longsword.128.d:0 "The capture of the city of Griffenheim has also awarded us with the highest profile prisoner of the war with the Empire - the Child-Emperor himself, Grover VI. It's a miracle that he's fallen to our hands in one piece - while the child had personally done nothing wrong, his name and lineage are followed by curses in Longswordian vocabulary, and any average soldier would have likely lynched him on the spot. Ever since the fall of Griffenheim, the young griffon has been held in custody away from the front, provided for and guarded by a handful of fanatically loyal pony soldiers - but this status quo cannot stay forever. Having silenced the calls of his subordinates to execute the child, Golden Morning has received two possible ideas.\n\nOne offers to send Grover to the forests of southern Longsword for permanent exile. The logging camps and agrarian communes of Longsword can certainly use more labor, and there, forced to serve as an equal to ponies and griffons, in contact with different traditions and numerous cultures, he can be groomed to be a model citizen. Perhaps, if the former Emperor shows promise, accepts pony culture into his heart, and integrates into the National Body, he can be provided with a Riverpony wife and touted as an example of unity between ponies and griffons.\n\nAnother idea sees this approach as too soft towards someone who represents the Grover lineage - the family which has done more than any other to cause strife between ponies and griffons. This proposal calls a massive show trial, where the former Emperor shall be put on the stage and forced to listen to witnesses from the entire Empire, each one detailing the crimes of the Grover dynasty. Historians will list all the belligerent wars, exploitation and suffering caused by his predecessors, Longswordian partisans will detail the horrors which Grover II's Knightly Orders caused in Vartai to modern day, Griffonian peasants will explain the injustices of the Imperial system and how their lives suffered from the feudal structure. The purpose of the trial will be to destroy the prestige of the Grover dynasty, and so will be publicized via any possible means.\n\nThe choice is yours, Vadeiva."

The thrift of the griffons, while often devolving into greed, blessed Griffonia with numerous palaces as beautiful as this one - to infuse this trait into the Riverponies was one of the Vadeiva's many goals. Perhaps, one day, Rijekograd and Lake City will be able to match Griffenheim.\n\nPaying it little thought, Golden Morning sat down in the throne at the palace's heart, looked through the empty hall surrounding it, and finally turned his eyes to the ceiling.\n\n"Is it over?"\n\nThe propaganda made sure to hide it, but by now, Morning was almost unrecognizable from the young, handsome stallion which had once joined the Longsword Liberation Army. The weight of each and every decision falls onto his shoulders, every single day passes as a string of tasks and orders from early morning to midnight, not a moment to himself, especially not during war, which at this point has become constant. The thought of sending thousands of creatures to death every day, the feeling that life is being reduced to numbers... All of it added to a severe toll, all of it left him frail, determined to push forward only with the knowledge that this struggle will bring a better life to everyone.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the stallion's expression soured. The voices in his head have turned dim over the years, and yet they all spoke in unison - it's not yet over. Golden Morning rose from the throne, making his way to the nearest window and staring out. The city continued to burn. The griffons were resisting, organizing underground societies, griffon nations outside of the Empire's reach will surely begin to act soon, too. And all of them wanted to expel the ponies out of Griffenheim. The real war was only beginning. \n\n"Fine. Then I'll fight until it's over.""

All of this tracked down the source to Longsword - the madpony Abba Povner and his regime dumped hundreds of tons of arsenic into the Griffking River, poisoning the river water and causing uncountable deaths.

One of his few friends who remained by his side, albeit reluctantly so, was Ludwig von Pliater.\n\n"What now, Abba?"\n\nThe question got the pony to turn around, facing his Griffon friend with a smile, for the first time in many years.\n\n"It's over, Ludwig. What the Gods wanted me to do, I have done.

What they have today is a chance to rebuild what has been wronged and restore the honor of Longsword, so it may continue to serve its duty in the greater Griffonian Empire.\n\nSilvertalon's position was different. To him, there was no turning back the clock - the past he experienced in his youth and the Rosewood Order seeks to defend may have been glorious and honorable, but you cannot rewrite the beliefs of an entire nation and subjugate them to what they've already abandoned. Longsword need to heal, and in order to heal, it needs a compassionate, constitutional government where all the citizens of Longsword are represented and which will establish a harmonious system - and the Longswordian army is the only force in the country which can manage this transition.\n\nBoth of the sides stand by their visions, but only one of them may end up adopted - and so one of them will have to stand down and accept the other's lead.

They fought, they made peace, they commenced raids against pony and griffon alike, but they hardly saw each other as a part of a single nation.

Though small and divided, they would unite in the face of a superior threat, and then return back to the status quo once peace has been achieved.

And yet, when the issue of new civil code and constitutional frameworks came up to the Provisional Government, it immediately threatened to split the fractured council. \n\nEveryone had their own idea of what Longsword should look like. Silvertalon's fellow officers were certain that only a strong hand regime can ensure stability in the fractured countryside and so called for laws which would grant the government high leeway in dealing with troublemakers. The commoners of Swordsson and Haarsingen, making up the business delegations, preferred a more representative system with more lax laws and regulations which would allow the average griffon to prosper with their own merit. Solarpluff Engelberg managed to convince General Silvertalon out of dismissing those clinging to their own ideas, however, and offered to listen out to both sides instead.\n\nIn response, Engelberg offered to invite legal scholars from the West, graduates of Yale's prestigious universities - with their insight, it can be possible to create a legal system which is objectively perfect no matter which person observes it.

Virtue cannot be compatible with corruption, nor can resistance against the new Longsword which Engelberg and Silvertalon seek to usher in.

For a country which has spent the past few centuries under absolute monarchism, it is a radical step in a new direction, and many were still uncertain if that's where Longsword should have gone.\n\n"And what will you do after the transfer of power, Herr Silvertalon?" Solarpluff Engelberg raised the question as the two griffon politicians drove across the Swordsson city centre in the same carriage. The General remained stoic, as always, but still replied:\n\n"I've done my duty, Herr Engelberg. I became a soldier to be able to one day defend from something trying to destroy it, and this is as good of a culmination to my career as any. When that's been achieved, what else can I do? You and the common griff you represent are far better at governance than I am."\n\n"The Army will still require your service, I assume."\n\n"Only until a new generation grows up. I'm not as fit for modern war as I used to be, anyway."\n\n"I believe this is your stop, General," the driver suddenly spoke up as the vehicle came to a halt - the Swordsson garrison was not far from here.

Of course, every single politician wanted themselves to be the "honorable and modest dictator" placed in power if and when that happens...\n\nWith a permanent scowl on his face, General Conrad Silvertalon returned to Swordsson. He had already received his assurances from the Rosewood Order - the Knights express their condolences and ensure that they will not act if Silvertalon does something... extreme. He did not even need to ask the civilian Army - they would follow his orders no matter what he did. He could become a Communist tomorrow and he was certain that at least half would brandish Caramel Marks's red books by the end of the week.\n\nSo everyone was accounted for.\n\nStepping in the center of the assembly, Silvertalon slammed his claw onto the ground to set the entire hall in complete silence, and began to read a military order to impose martial law, in all of Longsword. With a wavering, weakened voice - the General himself was uncertain whether this was the right move to take.\n\nBut now he had nobody else he could trust to rule in his stead, and all of Longsword has proven itself to be unable to rule itself.

"The prosecutor and witnesses may now present their evidence."\n\nA conga line of witnesses, all with their own grievances towards the dynasty. A historian from Swordsson, a member of the Longswordian Kings, was given the floor first, and recounted the story of the Crusades in Vartai - especially all of the crimes against the local ponies which Grover II's armies committed in their campaigns. A former Reformisten was pushed to the center in chains and loudly proclaimed that in the name of the Grovers, they took up the torch against all of Ponykind, and murdered thousands for little purpose. A small group of peasants from Interriver followed and explained that ever since Grover I took power in Herzland, he squeezed every last bit from his subjects to fund his conquests and lavish palaces, ignored the hunger and famine of the peasantry, and created an unjust system which persisted to this day. Even Golden Morning himself stepped forward to say a few words - explaining that the Grovers had done more than any other family to ruin the chance of a perfect union between Ponies and Griffons, that they willingly led the continent to war against itself, and wished for it to self-destruct.\n\nThe former Emperor was given no lawyer and only a few minutes to defend himself - but unable to say anything, he merely broke into tears. The judge's verdict was clear - for millions of listeners, he proclaimed that the House of Grover shall never have the mandate to rule Griffonia, and that Grover VI will be held imprisoned for the rest of his life."

While those knights who originated from landowning families in Herzland and beyond might have brought some skills in management with them, the rest had to study bureaucracy, economics and politics from scratch. They followed orders dutifully, however, and study circles were formed among the Order's chapters for that purpose.\n\n"And we've already made progress, have we not?" Brother Siegfried von Pluckwangen, a griffon of intimidating stature even among the Knights, stated during a stroll across the halls of Palisander Castle, the heart of the Order. Next to him was Grand Mistress Konrada Wavewing, silent as always - when her fellow knight suddenly stopped, so did she.\n\n"Perhaps, though he never vocalized it, Grand Master von Jungenwing had envisioned something like this from the very beginning. If it is our task to defend tradition and Griffonkind, then do we not deserve a state to support that goal?"\n\nWavewing remained silent. Eventually, however, she blurbed a brief "Yes."\n\n"In that case, Sister Wavewing, you should be proud that you have achieved his dream," von Pluckwangen continued, only to shut his beak when a glare beamed at him.

But not the Grand Mistress herself. From the castle, alongside a few trusted knights, she made her way to the ceremonies herself, getting more than a few griffs fleeing in fright. Not to participate in the fun, but rather to take a glance and ensure that her subjects do not engage in anything unacceptable.\n\nThen, one of the Katerin musicians, a young-ish looking griff with a lute in her claws, began playing a different, sadder tune - it may have been meant for ballroom dance and not for a crowd of citizens, but the people of Zeltstadt caught on with the change and followed along. The Grand Mistress was left frozen, however. Something had stirred inside of the stoic griffon, and she immediately excused herself from the knights party.

Eventually, she was shoved into the main hall, where, on the other side, the Grand Mistress was waiting.\n\nEven in full armor and after four decades of separation, that face was unmistakably familiar.\n\n"S-sister?.."\n\nWavewing stopped in her slow march. She had wanted to ask the musician about her song and whether there was something special about it, but this sudden yell froze her. Seeing the silence as the green light to move on, the captive continued:\n\n"It's me, Glinda... What happened to you? Mom and Dad thought you're dead, and yet you're... here..."\n\nNarrowing her eyes, the Grand Mistress stepped forward, pulled out a dagger and raised it by her beak, her voice uncharacteristically ferocious. "What madness are you insinuating?!" Frightened by the sight, the musician quivered, almost breaking into tears. After all, even if it really was her sister, she's become a warrior so ominous and powerful that even the knights of the holy orders of Katerin would shake in their boots.\n\n"Please don't..."\n\nGlinda's memories of her sister were distant and faint, but there were a few things she did remember. Out of the two Crowbeak children, Cynthia was always the louder and more troublesome one - and to calm her down, their father would often pick up his lute and play... this tune, right?

That griff is clearly insane, and whatever she is insinuating, it is merely the fables of her broken mind."\n\n"I would like to be the judge of that myself," the Grand Mistress bluntly replied. Von Pluckwangen could not allow himself to show it, but the stubborness was really getting under his nerves. Alas, that's what he should have expected to deal with when standing against the Grand Mistress.\n\n"You are our Grand Mistress, but we cannot grant you that power."\n\nWavewing remained silent, and then finally turned around. If the Order demands, then any knight, no matter if they are a new member or the Grand Master, must acquit and follow. And yet... one of the tenets of the ideal Rosewood Knight is the search for truth. No matter the situation, a Rosewood Knight cannot allow himself to live in a world of lies.

As soon as the frightened musician in her cell was assured that Wavewing was not here to oversee her execution, she began telling their story.\n\n"We grew up in Straßmark, not far off from the Scheißwald - our father was a musician, just like me.

"I'd love to say that I never lost hope that you might still be alive... but, really, I just wished to find you somewhere because life had turned a lot more lonely for me since then."\n\nWavewing remained silent - not because of her usual stoicness, but rather because she simply did not know what to say. The Order of Rosewood had always prided itself in the fact that many of their finest knights served in the knighthood since their youth, thus growing up with the right values instilled within them - but to think that they would go as far as to kidnap children in order to turn them into warriors...

One was to not call her Cynthia Crowbeak, even if that might be her real name - simply bringing it up carried far too much emotion for her to handle, especially when she was still grasping with the implications of her heritage. The second was to meet each other, from time to time, to let the knight learn more about a past which had, up to that point, has been a mystery to everyone, including herself.\n\n"What do I do now, Glinda?.." the knight muttered under her breath, staring out the window, leaving her cup of tea cold.\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\n"I... My whole life, the knighthood is everything I had ever known. I believed that I had chosen to serve virtue and so I did everything in my power to serve that virtue. And now, you have come into my life and revealed that everything I fought for was a lie.

Those knights who first brought me to the castle said they acted on your orders..."\n\n"Well, I am in charge of the nation, more or less..."\n\n"Then can't you do something to change this? You... clearly have a vision of what your Order should be like, and that there are things which you believe are wrong with what it's currently like. If you don't set things right, who will?"\n\n"But how can I have that vision you speak of?" Wavewing suddenly raised her voice. "The Order and its tenets is all I've ever believed in." Glinda wasn't convinced, she slightly tilted her head and replied:\n\n"Then you wouldn't be so ruffled about what happened, no? You'd simply accept that the Order was right to kidnap you and move on.

Once I arrive, we can move out and settle together near the great river, live as one and farm the land peacefully and even bring your entire family over, and perhaps one day, we shall sing our vows to Eyr for the wish of a family.\n\nBut Eyr let me return to your loving embrace once again before all else.\n\nYour feathered darling, Theophilus Neuleben.\""

longsword.160.d:0 "The following is an excerpt of one of the many letters exchanged between the Prelate of Arcturius in Kronburg and the esteemed 9th century Arcturian scholar and missionary Albrecht Ziel in a longstanding official correspondence, recently acquired from an old Posniak residing in Varena who claimed to be the descendant of one of the scholar's pony followers, the religious griffon's works having been painstakingly compiled into a tome and passed down from generation to generation throughout the years as \"The Missives\":\n\n\"To His Excellency of Kronburg,\n\nAs I near my tenth month since my arrival in this hamlet of pine trees, palisades and ponies that the locals call Visaginas, it is with great joy that I write to you that after weeks upon weeks of stone cold suspicion about the true intentions of my presence as a humble teacher of Arcturius to our Emperor's new subjects, my tireless efforts at gaining the trust and respect of the ponies has finally bloomed into something greater, all thanks to our new brother Širdis.\n\nWe first met in the shadow of a great oak tree beyond the protection of the palisade, the horned pony of modest stature yet fearsome with his bright red tribal paint and large wolven cloak routing a routine patrol of those brutish knights who kept coming time and time again to bother me in my prayers about my friendliness to the equines and studies of their faith. Perhaps the great wheel of fate blessed me that morning, for that mysterious pony and I began conversing, coming back day after day every misty morning underneath this same tree.\n\nHis name was Širdis, follower of the goddess Varėnė who had come to challenge me, representative of Arcturius, in a debate about who was the truest warrior of the two, he said. Yet, as many moons of dialogue passed, we began seeing eye to eye, not as two, but as one.\n\nIt eventually struck him like a thunderbolt. Varėnė, goddess of the hunt, was Arcturius' chosen one to the ponies of these lands, infusing courage and sacrifice in their hearts to become fearless. Širdis returned to Arcturius' embrace under my guidance that day as we prayed together under the great oak tree.\n\nBrother Širdis has vowed to bring me to the goddess's shrine soon, to thank her for the gifts she had brought from Arcturius to them.\n\nI can't wait.\""

The invitation had come from the Dusktalons themselves, though the original letter was long since lost. At least, it was lost until recently, when the invitation was found deep in the archives of the Swordsson Library.\n\nIt is... not quite what history has made it out to be.\n\n"To the Most Noble Hochmeisterin of the Rosewood Order\n\nFor as long as the Rosewood Order has been established in this land, I have felt nothing but deep and absolute annoyance at the entirety of Your order, and the steadfastness with which You have carried out Your work ensures that every day, this annoyance deepens. When I was rewarded these lands by Emperor Grover II, may he rest in peace, I imagined that I was blessed with a small corner of Griffonia where my word was to be law. I did not imagine that I would spend my days dealing with an endless stream of complaints, requests and 'advice' from the armor-plated pelican-heads that infest my county.\n\nMy scribe is currently taking dictation inbetween his horrified looks in my direction, so I suppose I should throw out a remark about the value of Your service both in times of war and peace, and that though it is like swallowing razors, I concede that my position and the stability of Longsword is due to the work of You and Your fellow knights.\n\nNow that I hopefully have said enough nice words to avoid You marching on my estate with Your entire order, I am formally extending my offer for the Hochmeister of the Rosewood Order to be given a standing position as advisor to my family, for as long as we rule these lands. Unless the skies fall down, neither I nor my descendants will be rid of You, and thusly we might as well play nice with You. Through this, you and your successors will have my ear, and the word of the Count will be moulded by Your counsel. It is my hope that this will further stabilize Longsword, and hopefully make You a little less hysterically irritating for me.\n\nSincerely\nCount Richart Dusktalon.""

The land itself is situated a mere hour south of Zeltstadt, and is both fertile and close to the centre of power. Also - if my romantic excesses may be indulged - an exceedingly fair place, situated by a small tributary to the Griffking in the rolling hills of these lands.\n\nThe acquisition was by and large expedient, and the tools given to me for the job proved quite sufficient to ensure that the locals were persuaded to donate it to the order. After recent events, their tempestuous nature has been curtailed quite effectively, and there were only occasional needs for my brothers to intervene more firmly. For the vast majority, the virtue in giving up their dwellings to us stood clear, and they departed with an impressive humility.\n\nYet, one small issue has arisen, which I feel pertinent to bring before You. During the acquisition, a fair number of natives threw themselves to the ground before me, quite fervent in their desire to stay on the land, and I decided to write to You of this. Though there will be no shortage of faithful griffons who seek to migrate into these lands, yet perhaps these natives can be taken on as servants of the order. I was told they would not require pay as long as they can stay on their 'ancestral lands', and though I am loath to indulge their delusions, I am nevertheless convinced their servitude may serve to civilize them.\n\nThe choice, however, lies with You, and beyond this trifling matter I have little else to report. I shall be back at the Chapter House within a forthnight, and shall then bring more detailed maps of the area.\n\nYour Faithful Servant\nRufus Klepper.""

Beyond the fact that just a few years ago the border between the two states was fortified and shut and that there were never such a grand movement of ponies across these regions, the returning children of Vartai were... Strange, to say the absolute least. While all of them wore some indication of Vartai, or specifically regional Longswordian ancestry, usually religious symbolism, beyond that there was no single term one could use to describe them all. The ponies were dressed in everything from modern suits to mere rags.\n\n."From where in the depths of Tartarus did he dig all of them out?"Starry Swirl sighed, while filling out the form, as yet another pony left the booth after showing a pendent with the symbol of Varėnė and answering certain questions in a extremely broken ilgakardijan. "Maybe he found a mass grave or something." Cloud Eyes, the armed guard meant to protect the post from potential enemies and infiltrators jested, only to be answered with an eye roll. It was a rather popular theory for the longest time, that Abba Povner was some sort of warlock or magician, prominent in dark and forbidden magics. Of course such an idea was absurd, earth ponies couldn’t become that powerful, could they? Besides...\n\nStarry Swirl’s inner monologue was interrupted by a nudge to her side. She lifted up her from eyes from the list laying on the table. Somehow an entire group of ponies that looked like they stepped out of an ancient tapestry, had marched in front of the booth without her noticing it. All unicorn, they were covered in armour that would make even Longswordian Kings jealous in intricacy and level of craft. They looked at her, seemingly slightly irritated. The mare in charge made a statement of some sort, but while Starry could understand a couple words, it felt archaic, like the hymns that were sung in the alkavietės. She shot a gaze at Cloud Eyes, who seemed as confused as she was, before opening her mouth to ask the mare if she perhaps spoke Rijekan as her Ilgakardijan was clearly incomprehensible to normal ponies, only to be interrupted by an avenger who too, seemed to have appeared from thin air.\n\n"Write down Wittenland, I will fill out the rest later on." The stallion ordered, while leading the group of alleged longswordians from Wittenland away from the booth.\n\nAs the group left from their eye-sight, Cloud Eyes grinned at Starry Swirl, as if assuming that the absurdity of the scene that just occurred some sort of proof."

Even in ones most fantastical dreams and most outlandish fantasies one wouldn’t think to see such a sight. There were thousands of griffons, perhaps tens of thousands, it was difficult to determine as the camp seemed to be quite cramped and most of the force were perhaps resting. Though one thing was easily noticeable, many of them, perhaps all among their ranks, were knights, for all the griffons that darted among the tents and other establishments of the camp wore armour. Two things were quite notable and rather strange considering how such forces look usually, lack of any banners or other defining symbols, and the fact that all the pieces of armour seemed to be dirty or rusted, as if someone had dragged them or even kept them in mud. Though perhaps something like that was to be expected?\n\n"I assume the barracks of Visaginas can house three more divisions for now." Arklid turned to the side to see Abba Povner himself approaching with a substantial retinue of griffon knights, though perhaps such a term wasn’t fitting anymore, for the troops following the pony looked quite... miserable and pathetic, compared to the Rosewood knights that Arklid had until now just assumed to be the average. Perhaps it was just the armour? After all the griffons themselves towered over Povner, and held themselves somewhat steady, even if it looked like they had been dragged through the dirt. Though considering the situation in the griffon parts of the continent, perhaps that was the case."Do not worry Comrade Povner, we will find enough place for your new... recruits? I must ask however, how many more are coming? And furthermore, not to sound insulting, but how can we trust foreign knights and griffons after everything..."\n\nArklid instantly regretted asking these questions, as while Povner didn’t seem angry or irritated, his gaze felt uncomfortable and piercing. Perhaps as an answer Abba raised his hoof into the air and shouted. "Death to Imperials! Death to Herzland! Glory to Varėnė!"\n\nThe griffons behind him followed suit. And as their voices echoed across the valley, the griffons in the camp started shouting the words too. Soon, the screams for imperials and herzlanders to perish were so loud they were deafening. Whatever the Soldier of the Gods had done to these griffons, their fervour was so astounding Arklid could only watch in amazement as they pushed themselves into greater and greater frenzy with their screams."

It was a rather strange moment of peace for both the creatures in this rather peaceful night. A moment for personal weakness for both, as they could drop off the masks of stoicism and professionalism kept through the days.\n\n"They are like the rats that they accused the faithful of being. No matter how much they fight and how many of them die, they always rise as a new Empire." The ashes from the cigarette fell on the expensive pavement as Povner ranted."I wanted to wait, to prepare, but we don’t have time! If we wait, the Herzland will just become stronger!"\n\n"Will and faith alone will not win this time either." Pliater bitterly spat out."There is no unit so elite and technology so advanced to bridge the gap. There can be no proper victory."\n\n"We need bodies... Always more bodies..."

"Ways without honour or true sacrifice, the same ways that the Black Cloaks would have considered, poison, plague, assassination. Ways that blindly target everyone, not just the guilty. But in our situation... Not that we have the option."\n\n"We have... We can have the bodies... The poison... The ways to cut the head from the snake..." Abba left out a pained sigh.

The guards would come to bring food and water, but they didn’t talk, and their eyes were empty, gazing into unseen distances.

Yet he persisted and started a new life in the city of Romau. He even created a family of his own. Yet the rumours about his alleged republican associations never subsided, and thus with Eyrite power growing and after several incidents with the Romau legion which indicated that neither he, nor his kin were welcomed in not just Romau, but all of Herzland. Thus, with help of some friends in Katerin, he fled to Longsword where he managed to become a minor clerk.\n\nHowever this didn’t continue for long as Pallas Dusktalon, ever growing in his insanity decided to begin the Longsword bloodbath during which he struck both pony and griffon which he thought as impure. For some reason, Hans’ family was targeted while he was on a mission in Katerin. Perhaps there was something that could have been done, but the civil war erupted right after. During it’s flames his family perished and the Longsword he returned to after was nothing like before. With nothing left and feeling cursed wherever he goes, Hans contemplated suicide... And then he was shown the true way. The way of vengeance, the way of true justice, the way of the faith in which the divine cared for the mortal.\n\nAs Hans ordered the other Kerštininkai to open fire on alleged black cloak supporters, he couldn’t stop himself from having a slight smirk. Joining Povnerites made him an accursed traitor and monster to many perhaps, he had heard accusations of being a bloodthirsty monster and nothing more than a thug, but Hans didn’t care. Even if it was indirect..."

longsword.182.d:0 "A year has passed since the Convention, and the cleansing which happened in the midst of it. Starry Night's visits to the prisons of Visaginas, once almost daily, have turned more and more infrequent - the mare's new responsibilities weighed on her and she's had less and less time to herself. Especially since these visits were not officially condoned.\n\n"Here, have this." Past the bars of the cell, she slipped through a lit cigarette, handing it to the prisoner - who accepted it after a bit of hesitation. With a faint smile on her face, Starry sat down on the other side.\n\nGolden Morning was still his attractive self - at least on the outside. According to Visaginas prison reports, ever since his imprisonment and the destruction of the Naujoji Grifonija organization, he has grown increasingly hard to get a bead on. Moody and unpredictable, speaking of betrayal and apocalyptic visions, speaking in graphic detail of just how doomed Longsword and the entire continent are, as if he's had a religious awakening.\n\nStarry didn't get a chance to experience it personally, however. Whenever she arrived to visit, he was always silent and stoic, only occasionally speaking his heart out. Mysterious, yet charming. Just the way she always remembered him, and the way she liked him.\n\n"I'm fine, thanks."\n\n"I haven't asked you how you're doing yet."\n\n"So now you won't have to. Aren't I helpful?"\n\nIt got her to giggle, faintly."

What world am I supposed to picture in my mind?"\n\nTruth be told, commander Nakties Šalna expected her new recruits to be a lot less philosophical. And yet this young mare stood before her, the uniform she was conscripted to wear clearly too large for her, with such wonder in her mind. To the conscript's surprise, her famously nigh-psychotic commanding officer suddenly pulled her to a hug, before waving towards the sky with her hoof.\n\n"It will be beautiful, incredible... Like all of our desires and dreams come true!"\n\n"Dreams come true..?"\n\n"You remember the War of Liberation, correct?" The mere mention of the decade long guerrilla war got the conscript's voice to crack as she replied:\n\n"Yes, both of my parents got sent to Pallas' camps..."\n\n"Then picture a world where all of the resources dedicated to such atrocities were instead put where they're truly needed. We won't have to call ponies 'ponies', or griffons 'griffons', and murder one another on that stupid distinction alone. We will build hospitals instead of armories, theme parks instead of barbed wire, and... dream anything we want!"\n\nTruth be told, Šalna hardly knew any more of what the Vadeiva's ultimate designs were. He only consulted himself, after all. So when definitive answers were lacking, imagination took hold instead - and much like Morning dreamt of his utopia, his subordinates dreamt of their own.\n\nThe conscript lost herself in thought for a second, dreams of a better world overtaking her for a second as well, before she finally replied: "...Why do I still have to wear this, though?""

These regions are by far the most influenced and defined by their Imperial past. Griffenheim is the rotten core of this disgusting ideal, as it’s both the Imperial capital and the domain of the Archon of Boreas. Romau houses the Archon of Eyr who reforged the once shattered city into a manifestation of inherently Imperial and Herzlander ideal. Finally, Bronzehill, the dog loyalists of the Empire and perhaps the greatest hypocrites of them all. Despite their origins as slaves in Diamond Mountain, having a first hand experience at the same sort of corrupt and brutal spirit that manifested itself across the Empire, they not only accepted the gifts of Grover II, but also became the greatest supporters of the Empire.\n\nAll of these realms are rotten to the core. Thus, they are punished the worst. They are occupied by a military force of the faithful which ensure that they are stripped of their industrial and military ability so that they are not a threat to anyone ever again. They will be turned into fully agrarian states, for which land is provided, to allow their populace to persist, yet become isolated from any trade or foreign relations. Any remaining imperial loyalists and notable characters which evaded the first purges will be hunted down until none remain.\n\nThe core of the empire and rotten domains that embody their corrupting ideals will be punished - eternally."

While Povner didn’t see any difference between Herzlanders, arguing that all of them were corrupt and deserving to perish, with the reigns of leadership passing to Ludwig von Pliater and less radical characters, such a punishment became impossible due to both logistical ability and the dawning immorality of such an action. Furthermore, while there are domains which are corrupted by imperial ideals through and through, among the more distant regions you can find griffons that posses a different mentality, be it something completely opposing imperial ideals or simply nationalism and regionalism.\n\nThese regions will be punished just like the rest of the Herzlands, however this punishment will be lesser, more controlled. These regions will be demilitarized and pushed into more agrarian character all the same. But eventually, these "Reconstruction Authorities" will hopefully be turned into their own independent countries, free from corrupting legacy of the Herzland, putting that rotten nightmare to rest."

edgy_poser_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th of April, 958 in Swordsson\n\n§YRank§!: Count of Longsword\n\n§YBiography§!: The current head of the noble Dusktalon family, Pallas assumed leadership not long after the County of Longsword declared independence from the Griffonian Empire. At first, he was content to continue the proud Longswordian tradition, but everything changed when he came in contact with the growing group of knights who called themselves the Reformisten. Their ideology and way of thought completely changed Pallas, and he set forth to implement their policies in Longsword, which culminated in the current bloodshed against the ponies. His single minded zeal towards achieving purity in Longsword compensates for his lack of proper leadership qualities, resulting in a dangerous obsession for attaining his dream, at any cost.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
female_bat_tito_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nDecember 11th, 971\nVarėna Countryside, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L Starry Night never thought she'd be any more than a footnote in history.\n\nBorn a foal of a locksmith and a farmer in the forested Longswordian south, she had a rather simple and idyllic childhood, composed of monotonous farming, hunting, and studying her father's craft. Her village did note that she was rather bright, she taught herself how to read by studying the religious texts of the village's Arcturian priest, for example, but neither she nor her family ever imagined that she'd end up leading a country. Not long after Count Dusktalon's regime turned towards senseless bloodshed, however, swarms of Reformisten descended upon her village, intent to round up and murder everypony. Armed with her father's hunting rifle, the 20-year old Starry was the first to rise in resistance, helped the few survivors escape, and swore as she watched her burning home to vanquish the Count's murderous regime by her own hoof.\n\nShe became a member of the Longswordian Liberation Army and soon rose to command the Visaginas Partisan District, striking against the Count and his lackeys from the foliage of the forests like their ancestors had done for centuries. Fearless, rumored to be invincible by her enemies, and speaking of a bright future free of fear, free of death and free of want, Starry Night has inspired many over the years. Any member of the Partisan movement, no matter where their allegiances lie, holds deep respect for her. As fearless and intimidating Longsword's greatest heroine makes herself out to be, however, even years of lead have not eroded the plain mare she is underneath. She is compassionate towards her comrades, always willing to hear them out and staunchly idealistic, to the point where she seems impressionable at times. To her, the Partisan struggle is not just one of freedom - it is one of building a better, ideal future upon those foundations. The future which the Reformisten ripped out of her hooves.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
reasonable_guy_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 3rd, 940\nHaarsingen, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L Ever since the era of the Crusades, the Silvertalon lineage gave their lives in the service of Longsword, and thus, as they believed, all of Griffonkind. Originally from Katerin, the ancestors of the family served in the retinue of Grover II, fighting in his numerous wars against the Riverponies - and when the great Emperor died, they retreated with the rest. Instead of returning to Katerin, however, they settled in what is today Longsword, and have served the County since then. Conrad Silvertalon is merely the last in a long tradition, a soldier from birth who followed the path of his father, fought in the eternal border conflict with the Riverponies, and achieved the rank of General he deserved.\n\nThe new Count, Pallas, was different. When he came to power, Conrad Silvertalon had only recently been promoted to General, and watched the young monarch assume his position with promise. And then, he was forced to stand back and watch the traditions he held dear be dismantled, and the fanatics from Hellquill storm across the Griffking to establish their new order of affairs. The general never held that much sympathy towards the ponies, but seeing them brutalized, radicalized, and Longsword run down by Pallas's leadership eventually broke his loyalties. Understanding that Count Pallas will only lead Longsword to ruin, he chose to resist, forming an anti-Reformisten kamarilla with Hochmeisterin Konrada Wavewing to set Longsword back towards the track it deserves to take.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
sad_knight_birb_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nDate unknown, around 950-960\nPossibly Haarsingen, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L The newest in a long line of Grand Masters of the Order of the Rosewood Spear, Konrada Wavewing has a lot of expectations to live up to. Alongside their peers to the north, the Knightly Order of Hellquill, the Rosewood Order had followed Grover II in the Crusades east and were granted lands in modern day Haarsingen as a result. Unlike Hellquill, however, they did not have a nation to call their own, instead working alongside the Dusktalon dynasty in the defense of the Frontier. When the latest Count of Longsword went mad, Wavewing chose to form the Kamarilla and conspired with General Conrad Silvertalon to overthrow him. It was the only breach of the knightly virtue of loyalty she allowed herself to make.\n\nThe creatures of Longsword are allowed to know very little about the Grand Mistress and her past - not that she knows much about it herself - but what they do know is that she is a presence to be feared. Not because she may be a bloodthirsty monster or a ruthless tyrant, but because her stoic demeanor and permanent scowl demand respect and freeze the heart of even the most hot-headed knight. In a world which turns increasingly chaotic and unjust, Wavewing sees herself as an anchor which can lead Longsword back to normalcy, if only she lives and breathes knightly virtue.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kajko"
sad_knight_birb_desc2:0 "§YBorn:§L\nJune 21st, 961\nKaterin Principality\n§YBiography:§L Though born to the family of a musician in the eastern reaches of Katerin, deep within the Scheißwald, Konrada Wavewing did not get to enjoy the idyllic life for long. At a very young age, the chick was separated from her home and fell to the claws of the knights of Rosewood - there, deep within the halls of Palisander Castle, she and numerous other stolen chicks were tutored to become the next generation of Rosewood Knights. Through force, manipulation and magic, she forgot everything about her past life, received a new name, and, seemingly forever loyal to the Order, she began her training as a knight. Her virtue, loyalty and talent were beyond exceptional, and throughout the years, she rose through the ranks until she became the Grand Mistress of the Order itself.\n\nNot long after the Longsword Civil War, she was awoken to her true nature by a party of musicians from Katerin, and a song she heard during her childhood, which the Order never managed to erase from her memories. In a long path of self-discovery, her faith in the Order and the tradition she was supposed to defend was shaken, but Wavewing clung to the ideals she held dear, and which transcended past the duties of the Order. In time, the griff's demeanor began to change. Ever so often, her subjects can see a smile on her face, and the Rosewood Order has begun to scale down their control of Longsword's society.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kajko"
lewd_event_star_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of August, 982 in Zeltstadt\n\n§YBiography§!: Former second-in-command to Count Dusktalon, Rosa Heidenreich was one of his earliest supporters when he began spreading the Reformisten values through Longsword. It was her hard work and dedication that got her to this position, and although some would say Rosa had the Count's personal interest, she vehemently denies any of that and insists it was through merit alone. Regardless, having spent many nights ruminating on the failures of the Reformisten ideology, it wasn't a light decision for her to overthrow the Count after their victory in the civil war. She now leads the former Black Cloaks as a ruthless bandit leader, free of any previous trappings, and interested only in extracting riches from others.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
pagan_larper_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nJuly 19th, 960\nSwordsson, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L Flawless Justice was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, to a lineage of Longswordian Kings - the descendants of the Longswordian pony nobility which ruled the land before the Empire's invasion, and were allowed to keep some of their power and privileges under the House of Dusktalon. Flawless Justice himself claims to descend from the house of Grand Duke Žemaitukas himself, the last ruler of Longsword, who united the pony tribes under one nation and fought a futile resistance against Grover II. Though his descendants never forgot this humiliation, they bent to the conqueror and his puppet in Swordsson like all of their peers. As long as he were to continue to safeguard their rights and traditions.\n\nNot long after Flawless Justice finished education in Griffenheim and returned home, the Empire collapsed, Longsword broke free, and soon came under the bloody claw of Count Pallas and the Reformisten. All the contracts and pledges which the Longswordian Kings held towards the House of Dusktalon vanished overnight, and this privileged class was now hunted down like the rest. The young noble, like many of his peers, chose to resist, moving to the forests and joining the Longswordian Liberation Army. There, they formed the White Faction, fighting for a free, traditional, harmonious Longsword, a restoration of the idyllic past which once was.\n\nFar from humble, Flawless Justice only barely tolerated working with the commoners and peasants before, and he does even less so now, when they claim of a desire to move into politics and pursue their ideological goals. The Longsword he heard about from romantic tales was simple and harmonious - those with blue blood govern with compassion, those below work for the good of the community. And it cannot be any other way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail"
crazy_bosniak_fascist_desc:0 "§YBorn:§L\nOctober 4th, 976\nVisaginas Countryside, County of Longsword\n§YBiography:§L Being born to a village of Posniaks - ponies who converted to the Archonite faith and accepted griffon customs over centuries of cultural integration - did not save Golden Morning from a childhood of suffering. At a young age, he had to escape to the forests with a handful of survivors from his village, fleeing the Black Cloaks and their rampage - the image of senseless slaughter, death, and an end to the peace he knew his whole life remained imprinted in his mind for long. Before Morning could starve to death far away from civilization, he was rescued by a small group of partisans led by Starry Night, an officer recently inducted into the Longsword Liberation Army. Lacking any option, he joined the IIA, becoming an officer himself and developing a close personal relationship with the mare who would eventually become Longsword's greatest heroine. Ferocious, determined, and lacking a sense of self-preservation, Morning gained the trust of his fellow Partisans as a loyal and competent commander.\n\nHis heart never found reprieve, however. What do creatures find in war, what pushes them to murder each other senselessly, eradicate their fellow creatures just because of their species, and achieve nothing but loss to all? His broken mind began to speak back to him - and it informed him that time is growing scarce. Griffonia, divided between two worlds, East and West, has always been at its own throats, these two worlds have always fought, but if this wheel of time continues any further, the end of the world as we know it will come. Only Longsword has the potential to put an end to this agony - here, in the forests of the Frontier, ponies and griffons managed to co-exist and create a super-culture, one which borrows superior traits from the griffons and Riverponies alike. This super-culture has a destiny to expand to encompass all of Griffonia - or die trying, and so watch the continent decay into nothing.\n\nA circle of followers gathered around Morning, the "Naujoji Grifonija" ("New Griffonia") movement, the first entity somewhat resembling a political party on Longswordian soil - and it shall stop at no sacrifice to achieve Longsword's prophetic destiny.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: bunnyshrubby"

### General Descriptions ###
6_million_imperials_desc:0 "§G[ACCESS GRANTED]§!\n\n§LEven among all the eccentric and strange figures which were born from the circumstances created by the brutal regime of Count Pallas and his Reformisten supporters, Abba Povner is an exception.\n\nAccording to comrade Starry Night and Povner himself, Abba was but another rural pony youth who sometimes dabbled in poetry and religious literature, who was later on inspired to take up arms against the Black Cloak regime in defence of this faith and in order to avenge the fallen faithful. He then rose through the ranks, becoming one of the most recognized members of the IIA due to both his skill with a rifle and command ability. However there are claims and rumors spreading around the ponies and griffons of Longsword that there is far more to Povner than simply some religious partisan... Some of the older guerrillas claim that Povner has to be a some sort of phantom, for he appeared out of nowhere one day, already a military leader with a following of religious zealots and repenters, that they had never seen or heard of anyone like this. Others claim that he is surely not a pony, at least not a living one, for they have seen him slain a dozen times, by bullet or by blade, and yet still persisting in the mortal world. Yet others claim that he cannot be hurt, for no bullet or blade can penetrate his hide. There are even claims that Povner has mystical powers more comparable to the precognitive abilities of the deer seers, than anything like pony magic.\n\nWhile Starry Night dismisses any such rumors, both Povner's most devout followers and greatest enemies believe them fully. But while the pony zealots and griffon converts that follow Abba claim that these are divine blessings, be it from Varėnė or lesser regional divinities, and that he is truly the soldier of the gods, his enemies claim that Abba is a practitioner of forbidden, dark magics or even necromancy, which he uses to cheat death and subjugate the minds of others. Of course, none of them dare to make such claims to him in person.\n\nHowever, while his past is shrouded in mystery and even his present is questioned by both friend and enemy alike, if Povner's own claims are anything to go by, the future is set in stone. The black cloaks... the griffon supremacists that allowed them to rise... the accursed Imperials whose doctrines led to their creation... they will pay for each and every Longswordian faithful that they killed."
commie_knight_desc:0 "Originally from the Principality of Lushi, Ludwig von Pliater grew up hearing stories about the gallant griffon knights and dreaming about becoming one himself. Due to these fantasies he eventually traveled to Longsword in order to join the crusade against what he then believed to be a threat to griffonkind. However, instead of a righteous knightly campaign in the name of Arcturius, Ludwig would only find a massacre of innocents by the mad Reformisten. In such a position, the idealist made a choice. He deserted from the knightly order and joined the partisans to fight against such injustice. Years of fighting the Black Cloaks have changed Ludwig, shattering his idealism and faith in griffon divinities. However his determination and ferocity are even greater than before as the vow to the goddess Varėnė, to avenge all the innocents slain, pushes him forward."
edgy_commie_boye_desc:0 "Lite was born in the distant East in 982 ALB, and had a tough life - losing his parents at young age caused him to live his childhood in an orphanage, only to be captured by the Barrad Pentarchy in the age of 13. Prior to his escape, he was experimented on in painful ways, causing him to develop enormous wings. The road to Longsword was indeed long and sword-related - he would have to fight his way to the country where he thought he would be safe from the chase. A lot of forest combat and in-chase tactics left him quite experienced in both by the time he finally arrived in Longsword, where his wounded, malnourished, exhausted body was picked up by pony resistance - he was actually planning on moving forward (which turned out to be north-west) but he was just too weak to go further. There he would heal up, learn how to live in society and showed surprising experience in forest tactics and planning which he learned during his captivity and escape, which gave him a reputation as a talented leader in the Longswordian Liberation Army. During the Longswordian Civil War he rose up with the rest of the ponies and griffon for the victory of Communism and achieving his dream - a world where no creature would be suppressed like Longswordian ponies once were."
yan_pony_partisan_desc:0 "Nakties Šalna was born a peasant in southern Longsword, and her first step towards a military career was no different from many of her comrades - in the form of a Reformisten raiding party designating her village as a killzone and opening fire. In the midst of chaos, fire and death, the seven year old mare was taken from her home by her uncle and carried to safety in the forests. The visage of bloodthirsty, black-cloaked Griffons burning everything in sight was imprinted in her mind, even if she was too young to understand what's happening at the time. The event left Šalna without purpose - her family was dead and her farm was gone; and it left her questioning the world and the idyllic life she used to have. Lacking any other options, she grew up alongside the Partisans and trained to become a warrior in her own right.\n\nIn the Longswordian Liberation Army, Šalna was assigned to Golden Morning's squad and quickly grew attached to him. In the future leader of Naujoji Grifonija, she found everything she needed - an ideology to fill the void in her heart, a strong and mysterious stallion to learn more about, and a charismatic speaker who could convince her to do anything. Šalna became one of his followers, but her relationship towards him went far deeper than anyone else - it devolved into mania, psychotic mania, a fervent desire to get Morning to pay attention to her and solely to her, even as the stallion was clearly more interested in someone else. Lacking any other way to channel her emotions, she turned even more towards the art of war, gaining a reputation as a psychotic soldier who eschews any value to her life if it means the Vadeiva will give her a glance."
